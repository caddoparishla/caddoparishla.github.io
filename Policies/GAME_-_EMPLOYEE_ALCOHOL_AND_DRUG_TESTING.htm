<p style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION TO THIS POLICY</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Alcohol and Drug Testing Program is not to be confused with the Employee Assistance Program. (EAP) &#160;These programs are located in the same office but function under different policies and procedures. &#160;A brief description of each program is outlined below:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EAP) AS IT RELATES TO THE ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING POLICY</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The EAP Office is serviced by a Certified Employee Assistance Professional (CEAP). &#160;The EAP Office functions to service employees who are experiencing problems and are seeking assistance. &#160;Acceptance of EAP services is completely voluntary. &#160;Employees may contact this office in various ways. &#160;Some employees visit this office of their own volition, known as a self-referral; while others are recommended to the EAP Office by their supervisor, known as a supervisory-referral. &#160;Accepting (and using) EAP services through either method is voluntary. &#160;Employees using EAP services <u>will not</u> have their employment jeopardized. &#160;The EAP Office is a <u>helping service</u> system with no punitive or judicial authority.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ALCOHOL/DRUG TESTING AND TREATMENT PROGRAM</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This program is serviced by a certified Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). &#160;This program specifically services:</p>

<p><u>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</u></p>

</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<div style="list-style: upper-alpha; margin-left: 2em">
<ol start="1" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p>Caddo Parish School Board (CPSB) fully supports the idea of alcohol and drug-free workplaces for employees and students. &#160;The CPSB respects the individual's rights to privacy and also believes that the safety and well-being of its students and employees require that it take legally permissible steps to prevent or eliminate the use or abuse of drugs in the workplace; or the use of alcohol (on the job) by its employees. &#160;The CPSB adopts this policy to maintain the safe and efficient operation of its schools, ensure the physical safety of the children of Caddo Parish, and decrease the potential spread of drug use among its students. &#160;The CPSB has a compelling interest and commitment to eliminate illegal and unauthorized drug use (including the unauthorized use of alcohol), drug users, drug activities, and drug effects from all of its workplaces. &#160;Drug abuse is one of the most serious problems confronting our society today. &#160;Unfortunately, neither our workplaces nor our schools are immune from the drug scourge causing such problems. &#160;The School Board's policy is designed to prevent drug users from obtaining employment positions and to aid in detecting those employees in such positions who use drugs so that they may undergo treatment as a prerequisite to keeping to their jobs.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPSB policy prohibits the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or intoxication due to or the use of a controlled substance or alcohol by its employees in any workplace or property owned, leased, or used by the CPSB. &#160;This policy also applies to any school-sponsored or supervised activity and to any school board-owned or leased vehicle including school buses.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly, it shall be the policy of the CPSB to vigorously comply with the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, and to implement the alcohol and drug testing program herein contained in accordance with Act 1036 of the 1990 session of the Louisiana Legislature (now La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§49:1001, et seq) and the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991: (<a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title49-section31306&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">49 USC 31306</a>) Federal Register/Volume 59, No.31, (<a href="https://sr2.army.mil/Documents/dtc/References/PLs/PL 102-143 Title V Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991.pdf" target="_blank">Public Law 102-143, 2 Title V</a>). &#160;Employees subject to the federal act shall be subject to an alcohol and drug testing program that will fulfill the requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-382" target="_blank">49 CFR Part 382</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/part-40">49 CFR Part 40</a>.</p>
