<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
<p class="PlainText">A. The State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education shall seek to establish a culture in all schools and school systems in which failure is not an option and all students are supported to meet or exceed grade-level standards.&#160;&#160;Schools shall take steps to implement instructional strategies designed to provide students in all classes with engaging, challenging assignments based upon real-world tasks through which students are required to creatively solve problems, interpret and evaluate information, and communicate effectively.</p>
<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
<p class="PlainText">B. The board shall develop objective criteria for schools to use in the identification of students, as early as the sixth grade, who are at risk of being underprepared for the next level of study and develop strategies to address their specific needs and provide them with the opportunity to graduate from high school and develop the skills necessary to successfully enter the workforce.</p>
<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
<p class="PlainText">C. The Department of Education shall provide professional development and support to principals and teachers to assist them in implementing new planning and instructional strategies that will engage more students intellectually, emotionally, socially, and behaviorally in the learning process and that create learning environments in which students can see the value of the information and skills they are required to learn and are thus motivated to achieve.</p>
<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
<p class="PlainText">D. The board shall allow schools and school districts sufficient flexibility in scheduling options and the length of the school day and year in order to provide middle and high school students with the range of programs and supports they may deem necessary to ensure that more students graduate from high school and are prepared for postsecondary education and careers.</p>
<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
<p class="PlainText">E. (1) The board shall require all city, parish, and other local public school boards to implement existing programs that provide academic support, dual enrollment opportunities, industry-based skills training, soft skills training, work-based learning opportunities, and adult mentoring to students, as funding is available.</p>
<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
<p class="PlainText">(2) City, parish, and other local public school boards shall identify any available funds that could be utilized to support immediate implementation of such programs, including funding provided through the minimum foundation program and other sources of local, state, federal, or private funding.</p>
<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
