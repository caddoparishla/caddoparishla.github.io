The obligations heretofore incurred by the State Board of Education created by Article XII, Section 4 of the Constitution of 1921 in connection with any contract or agreement with respect to elementary and secondary schools, vocational-technical and post secondary vocational-technical schools and programs except in colleges and universities, and special schools shall be preserved and discharged by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education on and after its first meeting. All of such obligations and all books, papers, records, money, and other property heretofore owned, possessed, controlled, or used by the State Board of Education in the exercise of its functions relating to public education, schools, and programs under its jurisdiction with respect to elementary and secondary education, vocational-technical and post secondary vocational-technical education except in colleges and universities, and with respect to special schools are hereby transferred to the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, effective with the first meeting of said board. All employees heretofore engaged in the performance of the functions of the former State Board of Education shall, insofar as practicable, continue as employees of the board created in this Part and shall retain all rights, privileges, and benefits enjoyed by each under the former board.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. (1) The obligations incurred by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education prior to July 1, 1999 in connection with any contract or agreement with respect to post-secondary vocational-technical schools shall be preserved and discharged by the Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges. The Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges shall act as successor to the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in all respects insofar as obligations of the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education exist regarding post-secondary vocational-technical schools. All of such obligations and all books, papers, records, money, and other property owned, possessed, controlled, or used by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in the exercise of its functions relating to post-secondary vocational-technical schools are hereby transferred to the Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges. All employees heretofore engaged in the performance of the post-secondary vocational-technical school functions of the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education and the state Department of Education shall, insofar as practicable, continue as employees of the Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges and shall retain all rights, privileges, and benefits enjoyed by each under the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education or the state Department of Education.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(2) Further, any reference in this Chapter to the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, the state Department of Education, or the state superintendent of education insofar as such reference is related to the exercise of jurisdiction over post-secondary vocational-technical schools or the employees thereof shall mean and be interpreted to mean the Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges, except as is clearly inconsistent with the supervisory jurisdiction of institutions provided by the education governance and management structure established in Article VIII of the Constitution of Louisiana.</p>
