<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. Whenever the Jefferson Parish School Board determines that a parcel of its property adjacent to the L.W. Higgings High School is no longer needed for school purposes and that the best interest of the public school system would be served by the exchange of such land for other land of comparable value, the board may exchange such land for a parcel of land in Jefferson Parish owned by the West Bank Cathedral, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this Section.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. The Jefferson Parish School Board shall hold a public hearing to receive public comment concerning the exchange of such lands. Prior to the public hearing, the board shall obtain an appraisal from a certified appraiser of the lands being considered for exchange and such appraisals shall be available for public inspection at the hearing.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;C. The school board shall provide notice of the public hearing and notice of its intent to consider the exchange of land as well as a brief description of both pieces of land by advertisement in the official journal of the parish in which the land is situated on at least three separate days at least thirty days prior to the date on which the hearing is to be held.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;D. After such hearing and after giving due consideration to any public comment, the board may, at its next regularly scheduled meeting, vote to authorize the advertised exchange, provided that the board determines that the exchange is for a valid purpose in the best interest of the school board and, that the lands to be exchanged are of comparable value. The president of the board shall proceed with the exchange of the lands in accordance with the law and upon authorization of the board.</p>
