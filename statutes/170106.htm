PART II. PARISH SCHOOL BOARDS</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle03">SUBPART B-1. ASSIGNMENT, TRANSFER, AND CONTINUANCE OF PUPILS</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle03">&#160;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle04">17:106 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Objections and requests; hearings and investigations</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;A parent or guardian of a pupil may file in writing with the local school board objections to the assignment of the pupil to a particular school, or may request by petition in writing, assignment or transfer to a designated school or to another school to be designated by the board. Unless a hearing is requested, the board shall act upon the same within 30 days, stating its conclusion. If a hearing is requested, the same shall be held beginning within 30 days from receipt by the board of the objection or petition at a time and place designated by the board.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;The board may itself conduct such hearing or may designate not less than three of its members to conduct the same and may provide that the decision of the members designated or a majority thereof shall be final on behalf of the board. The school board is authorized to designate one or more of its members or one or more competent examiners to conduct any such hearings, and to take testimony, and to make a report of the hearings to the entire board for its determination. No final order shall be entered in such case until each member of the school board has personally considered the entire record.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;In addition to hearing such evidence relevant to the individual pupil as may be presented on behalf of the petitioner, the board shall be authorized to conduct investigations as to any objection or request, including examination of the pupil or pupils involved, and may employ such agents and others, professional and otherwise, as it may deem necessary for the purpose of such investigations and examinations.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;For the purpose of conducting hearings or investigations hereunder, the board shall have the power to administer oaths and affirmations and the power to issue subpoenas in the name of the state of Louisiana to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence. All such subpoenas shall be served by the sheriff or any deputy of the parish to which the same is directed; and such sheriff or deputy shall be entitled to the same fees for serving such subpoenas as are allowed for the service of subpoenas from a district court. In the event any person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued hereunder, any district court of this state within the jurisdiction of which the hearing is held or within the jurisdiction of which said person is found or resides, upon application by the board or its representatives, shall have the power to compel such person to appear before the board and to give testimony or produce evidence as ordered; and any failure to obey such an order of the court may be punished by the court issuing the same as a contempt thereof. Witnesses at hearings conducted under this Subpart shall be entitled to the same fees as provided by law for witnesses in the district courts, which fees shall be paid as a part of the costs of the proceeding.</p>
