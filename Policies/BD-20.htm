<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Title">SCHOOL BOARD POLICY</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board shall formulate policies to guide the action of those to whom it delegates authority.&#160;&#160;These guides shall constitute the policies governing the operation of the school district.&#160;&#160;They shall be recorded in writing and made a part of the official School Board <b><i>Policy Manual</i></b>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The formulation and adoption of School Board policies shall constitute the primary method by which the School Board shall exercise its leadership in the operation of the school district.&#160;&#160;When establishing School Board policies, the School Board shall prioritize student achievement, financial efficiency, and workforce development on a local, regional, and statewide basis.&#160;&#160;The study and evaluation of reports concerning the execution of its written policies shall constitute the basic method by which the School Board shall exercise its control over the operation of the school district.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The policies of the School Board are meant to be interpreted in terms of Louisiana laws, rules and regulations of the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, and all other regulatory agencies within the local parish, state, and federal levels of government.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>POLICY ADOPTION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For a policy to be adopted by the School Board, it must receive a <i style="font-weight: bold;">simple majority of School Board members present and voting</i>.&#160;&#160;A policy recommended to the School Board shall be introduced at the executive committee work session and officially adopted at the next School Board meeting, unless the School Board votes otherwise.&#160;&#160;This practice provides School Board members time to study the proposed policy and to give interested parties an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The formal adoption of School Board policies shall be recorded in the minutes of the School Board.&#160;&#160;The official minutes shall constitute the authority for any change made in the <b><i>Policy Manual</i></b>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board is recognized as the legal body authorized to approve policies for the School District, and shall not delegate or relinquish that authority to another party or group.&#160;&#160;The School Board welcomes comments and suggestions on local policy matters, and shall comply with all laws addressing proper involvement of other parties in the policy process.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>POLICY REVIEW</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall periodically direct the systematic review of its policies.&#160;&#160;The Superintendent may involve representative groups of administrators, teachers, supervisors, students, support personnel and lay citizens relative to policies affecting each group.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall establish a <i>discipline policy review committee</i> in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a id="id1" href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/170416-8.htm');return false;" name="id1">17:416.8</a>.&#160;&#160;The purpose of the discipline policy review committee shall be to review discipline policies of the School Board to assure consistency with state law, receive input into the effectiveness of established policy, and make recommendations to improve policy provisions, and to assist the School Board in the orderly operation of the school district.&#160;&#160;In particular, state law requires a policy review committee to review the School Board’s student discipline policies annually to make recommendations for appropriate revisions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A public hearing shall be held on the recommendations to improve policy revisions and to assist the School Board in the orderly operation of the school district before the School Board considers revising any of the discipline policies.&#160;&#160;State law also requires the administrators, teachers and parents of each public school to meet annually and develop or review the discipline regulations for their school and assure compliance with School Board policy and state law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>POLICY DISSEMINATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall direct the Superintendent to establish and maintain an orderly plan for disseminating School Board policies and administrative regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>School Board policies and administrative regulations and procedures shall be made accessible to all employees of the School District directly or indirectly affected by those policies.&#160;&#160;School Board policies and administrative regulations and procedures shall also be made accessible to members of the School Board, students and members of the community served by the School District.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SUSPENSION OF POLICY</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In accordance with <u>Roberts Rules of Order</u>, the operation of policy or section of policy not established by law or contract may be temporarily suspended by a <span style="font-weight: bold;"><i style="font-weight: bold;">two-thirds</i></span> <i style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; font-weight: bold;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">(⅔)</font></span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">vote of School Board members present and voting</span></i> at a regular or special meeting.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ADMINISTRATION IN ABSENCE OF POLICY</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In cases where action must be taken within the School District where the School Board has no formalized policy statement, the Superintendent shall have the power to act.&#160;&#160;His or her decisions, however, shall be subject to review by action of the School Board at its regular meeting.&#160;&#160;It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to inform the School Board promptly of such action and of the need for policy if in his or her best judgment, a need for such policy exists.</p>
