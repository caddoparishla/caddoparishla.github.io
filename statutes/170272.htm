The fact that any board is excluded, as here provided, from participation in the program established by this section shall in no case be construed to prohibit such school board from offering and conducting French courses in the curriculum of the schools it administers. In any school where the program provided for herein has been adopted the parent or other person legally responsible for a child may make written request to the parish school board requesting that said child be exempted from this program.</span></p>

Requests already received from school boards for exclusion from the provisions of Act 408 of 1968 shall also be valid for exclusion from the provisions of this Act unless individual school boards deem otherwise. School boards which have not already requested exclusion may do so at any time between July 1, 1971, and the beginning of the 1972-1973 school year.</p>
