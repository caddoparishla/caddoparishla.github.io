<p class="Title">VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board recognizes that students may be at home or in another location that is not on school property as they participate in virtual instruction. &#160;The Caddo Parish School Board specifically recognizes and takes into consideration the students’ and families’ right to privacy and other constitutional rights. &#160;However, the Caddo Parish School Board is required to provide educational services to all students. &#160;Students who attend school through virtual instruction shall participate without causing substantial interference with the educational process of other students.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Therefore, the Caddo Parish School Board declares that when a student is participating in school utilizing virtual instruction, the student is hereby expected to follow the rules of the Caddo Parish School Board so as to not interfere with the instruction of other students. &#160;This policy provides clearly defined conduct which the Caddo Parish School Board believes will cause substantial interference with the educational process and has created narrowly tailored disciplinary guidance in order to address the compelling governmental interest of providing quality education to all students while receiving virtual instruction. &#160;The discipline guidelines are intended to be progressive in nature depending upon the particular action(s) of the student.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Conduct that is unacceptable and which would lead to the imposition of discipline in the regular classroom is typically unacceptable in the virtual classroom as well. &#160;Regardless of the model of instruction, student conduct is governed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a id="id1" href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/170416.htm');return false;" name="id1">17:416</a> and the <i>Student Code of Conduct</i> and/or <i>Student Handbook</i>. &#160;At the same time, for alleged misconduct which occurs during virtual instruction, school-based administrators shall consider the need for maintaining order and appropriate conduct, the school’s interest being impacted, and the student’s and family’s right to privacy and constitutional rights while at home or in a location that is not school property.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student and his family shall not waive their constitutional rights by electing virtual instruction. &#160;At the same time, students engaging in virtual instruction shall insure that, prior to logging into and during any virtual classroom, the view from their camera is free of any object, writing, picture, or other display which, if possessed on school buses, in the classroom, or on school property, would subject the student to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students are cautioned that the virtual classroom is for instruction and for engaging with peers and teachers for educational purposes. &#160;Students must not handle or display items, toys, messages, images, or personal property or engage in conduct unrelated to the lessons taking place. &#160;Students are not expected to be performing non-classroom related activities while participating in virtual classroom instruction. &#160;Non-classroom related activities include but are not limited to operating a motor vehicle. &#160;Students who engage in conduct in the virtual classroom that violates the <i>Student Code of Conduct</i> and this <i>Virtual Instruction Discipline</i> policy may be subject to discipline in accordance with the <i>Student Code of Conduct</i> and this policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The following non-exclusive list of behaviors are prohibited in the virtual classroom and may result in disciplinary action:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Bullying and/or cyberbullying<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of harassing or discriminatory language<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of obscene language, profanity, inappropriate language, writing or drawings<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Displaying obscene gestures, drawings, images, audios, videos, etc.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Displaying pornography or nudity whether in a printed or digital context<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Committing lewd or sexual acts or simulations*<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeated disruptions of the classroom<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display of nudity, indecent dress, disrobing, etc.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exhibiting disrespect for the teacher or other school personnel<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interference with the instructional audio or video<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handling or display of weapons or facsimile weapons<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use or display of drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or vaping devices<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cheating on assignments, i.e. sharing work, answers, etc.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divulging confidential information<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violation of computer/password security<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violations of the School Board’s/School’s Acceptable Use Policy or Device Contract<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operating a motor vehicle during virtual instruction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -10px; margin-left: 10px;">* School and/or district officials may be required, as mandatory reporters, to alert local law enforcement and/or the Department of Children and Family Services if they observe conduct, messages, images, or objects that raise legitimate concern for the safety and well-being of students in the virtual classroom. &#160;This may include students handling weapons in the virtual classroom, even if it is subsequently learned that the weapon is a toy or facsimile, as it is not always possible to determine remotely whether the weapon is real or not.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The context in which student behavior occurs is important, however, and will be taken into consideration by School and School District administrators in determining whether there has been a violation of the Code of Conduct. &#160;As with all other forms of misconduct, the level of discipline, if any, for violations in a virtual setting will depend upon the age of the student, seriousness of the offense, the disruptive nature of the misconduct, whether the conduct involved violence or the threat of violence, whether the misconduct impacted the safety or orderly environment of the classroom, the student’s prior disciplinary record, etc.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Although the Caddo Parish School Board has listed certain offenses which clearly substantially interfere with the educational process, it recognizes that all offenses cannot be described in one document. &#160;If a student commits a serious offense that is not written in these guidelines that substantially causes disruption in the virtual instruction setting, that student may be removed from the school setting and may be subject to discipline up to and including expulsion.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This policy and discipline guidelines are to be provided to the students and their parents in accordance with Caddo Parish School Board policy.</p>
