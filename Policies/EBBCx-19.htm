<p class="Title">EMERGENCY/CRISIS MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-underline: black;">COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR EVACUATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It shall be the policy of the Caddo Parish School Board to provide a comprehensive plan for evacuation of schools in the event of a disaster. &#160;Disaster may come in many forms such as chemical spills, bomb threats, and/or a state of National Emergency. &#160;In cooperation with the local police and fire departments, 911 Call Center, and the Caddo/Bossier Office of Emergency Preparedness, the plan shall include all centers and schools located in Caddo Parish.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>CRISIS MANAGEMENT AND RESPONSE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Unanticipated tragic events can quickly escalate into a school-wide catastrophe if not dealt with immediately and effectively.&#160;&#160;School personnel shall plan in advance for the welfare, safety, and care of students and staff members.&#160;&#160;Every school shall be required to have a <i>Crisis Management and Response Plan</i>.&#160;&#160;A <i>Crisis Management and Response Plan</i> means a plan to address school safety and the incidence of a shooting or other violence at schools, on school buses, and at school-related activities; to respond effectively to such incidents; and to ensure that every student, teacher, and school employee has access to a safe, secure, and orderly school that is conducive to learning. &#160;Such plans shall also address the management of any other emergency situation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The <i>Crisis Management and Response Plan</i> shall be prepared by each public school principal jointly with local law enforcement, fire, public safety, and emergency preparedness officials.&#160;&#160;In preparing the plan, the principal and such officials shall consider and include, if appropriate, input from students enrolled in the school and their parents, teachers at the school, other school employees, and community leaders.&#160;&#160;The plan, which shall focus on preventing the loss of life and the injury of students and teachers and other school employees, shall detail the roles and responsibilities of each school employee and the relevant coordination agreements, services, and security measures of a school and provide for parental notification in the event of a shooting or other violent incident or emergency situation.&#160;&#160;The plan may also provide for the counseling of students by mental health professionals, encouraging peer helper programs, and identifying students who may have experienced rejection or other traumatic life events.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each principal, jointly with local law enforcement, fire, public safety, school resource officers, and emergency preparedness officials, shall review the plan at least once annually and shall revise the plan as necessary.&#160;&#160;In reviewing and revising the plan, the principal and such officials shall consider and include input, if appropriate, from students enrolled in the school and their parents, teachers at the school, other school employees, and community leaders.&#160;&#160;When conducting the annual review for a high school, the school principal shall seek input from the president of the senior class or the president of the student council, and at least one other responsible student selected by the principal as representatives of students enrolled in the high school.&#160;&#160;Each principal shall submit such plan in writing to the Superintendent for approval at least once annually, including upon each revision, and shall notify all teachers and other school employees of the contents of the plan and any revisions made to it.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Within the first thirty (30) days of each school year, each principal shall conduct a safety drill to rehearse the components of the <i>Crisis Management and Response Plan</i>.&#160;&#160;Not later than seven (7) days after the drill, the principal shall submit a written report summarizing the details of the drill to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent shall make an annual report to the School Board on the status of the plan of each school under the School Board’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>OTHER EMERGENCY DRILLS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board shall require procedures be planned by the principal and faculty of each school to assure orderly movement and evacuation of students to the safest area in the event of fire, weather, or other disasters.&#160;&#160;Practice drills shall be used to ensure the effectiveness of the procedures.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Every separate administration building shall conduct practice drills as well.</p>
