<p class="PdfParaStyle05">A. When a member retires, if he earned annual leave and it was accrued under established leave regulations and an attendance record has been maintained on the employee, he may purchase his unused accumulated annual leave for which he is not entitled to payment and shall receive one day of service credit for each eight hours of unused annual leave purchased. In order to purchase the unused annual leave as service credit he shall pay to the retirement system an amount which, on an actuarial basis, totally offsets the increase in accrued liability of the system resulting from the receipt of the credit. The amount payable shall be calculated by use of the actuarial funding method, assumptions, and tables in use by the system at the time of purchase. Any leave purchased under this Section cannot be used to attain eligibility for any benefits and cannot be used in the computation of average compensation. The employing agency, in its discretion, may pay not more than fifty percent of the purchase price. However, if it makes such a payment, it shall then make such payment, in the same percentage, with respect to all employees who make application.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">B. (1) This Section shall apply to all members who are not employees of the state or a state agency and who are not covered by the provisions of R.S. 42:421.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(2) This Section shall also apply to all members who are employees of the state or a state agency who were not eligible for a service retirement on June 30, 1990, but only to unused annual leave earned after June 30, 1990. Annual leave last earned shall be first used.</p>
