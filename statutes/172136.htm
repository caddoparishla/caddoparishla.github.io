<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;The State Board of Education and the Board of Supervisors of Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College are hereby authorized and directed to take such action as in necessary to increase the tuition fees charged students attending the state-owned and operated colleges and universities who are residents of other states to an amount exceeding the tuition fees charged to instate students at said institutions by not less than three hundred fifteen dollars per semester and not less than one hundred fifty-five dollars per summer session, if a semester plan is in effect, and by not less than two hundred ten dollars per trimester, if a trimester plan is in effect; provided, however, that any such student who was enrolled as a student and was in good standing during the 1969-1970 school year and/or the 1970 summer session shall be allowed to continue at the same rate of tuition he was then paying so long as he continues as a student in good standing and his education is not interrupted. Failure to attend a summer session or absence due to service in the armed forces of the United States shall not be deemed to be an interruption. The state board of education and the board of supervisors may enter into reciprocal agreements with the governing bodies of the various colleges and universities located in any state adjacent to the State of Louisiana under which the tuition fee charged students who are residents of such adjoining state shall be in the same amount as the tuition fee charged by that state to residents of Louisiana who attend colleges and universities within the same state. The mandatory tuition provided for in this section shall not apply to students enrolled in any graduate school, including schools of medicine and law. The tuition for such students shall be fixed by the Board of Supervisors of the Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College or the State Board of Education for such schools under their respective authority. And student residing in a foreign country shall have his or her tuition waived by the President of any state college or university when said foreign student is to attend said institution as a result of a scholarship or stipend given by the State of Louisiana or of any of its agencies.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;The various colleges and universities may reduce the nonresident tuition fee by ten per cent for any student who chooses to reside in a campus dormitory.</p>
