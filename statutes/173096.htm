<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(ii) The federal adjusted income of the beneficiary's family is less than thirty thousand dollars or the beneficiary must be eligible for a free lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Act (42 USC 1751 et seq.).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(iii) The beneficiary is not a member of the account owner's family nor a member of the family of any member or employee of the authority and the office of student financial assistance.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(iv) The deposits to the account are an irrevocable donation by the owner.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) The person completing the account owner's agreement for an education savings account shall be the "owner" of the account.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>B. (1) An education savings account may be established for a person who is an "independent student" as defined by the Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended or as hereafter amended, who files an individual federal income tax return in their name, and designates himself as the beneficiary of the education savings account.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) Accounts established by the authority under this Subsection shall differ from other education savings accounts by the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(a) The beneficiary of the account may not be changed or substituted unless the new beneficiary is "a member of the family" as that term is defined in 26 U.S.C. 529(e)(2) as amended.</p>

<p>(b) An account established under this Subsection shall be fully funded as defined under Subsection D of this Section.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>C. (1)(a) An education savings account may have only one designated beneficiary.&#160;&#160;The account owner shall designate the beneficiary, provided that an account owner meeting the classification requirements of R.S. 17:3096(A)(1)(e) may authorize the authority to designate the beneficiary.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) Persons who are eligible to establish an education savings account for more than one beneficiary shall establish a separate account for each beneficiary.&#160;&#160;The beneficiary of each account so established shall be eligible for earnings enhancements in accordance with Subsection E of this Section and the account shall be subject to all other terms, conditions, and fees applicable to an education savings account.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>D. Accounts which are fully funded are no longer eligible for state-appropriated earnings enhancements.&#160;&#160;For purposes of this Chapter, fully funded shall mean that the redemption value is equal to or greater than the projected sum of five times the annual qualified higher education expenses at the highest cost Louisiana public college or university, projected to the scheduled date of the beneficiary's first enrollment into a college or university.&#160;&#160;For purposes of this Chapter, the scheduled date of the beneficiary's first enrollment into an institution of postsecondary education shall be the expected date of enrollment as reported by the beneficiary.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>E. (1) Annually, the authority shall credit the beneficiary of an education savings account an earnings enhancement as calculated pursuant to this Paragraph.&#160;&#160;An earnings enhancement shall be determined by adding the deposits made to the account by the owner during the calendar year and multiplying that sum by the rate appropriate to the owner as determined by Paragraph (3) of this Subsection.&#160;&#160;Earnings enhancements awarded in any year shall not exceed the balance in the Savings Enhancement Fund.&#160;&#160;The authority shall reduce earnings enhancement rates, pro rata, so that the total of the earnings enhancements to be awarded in any year does not exceed the balance in the Savings Enhancement Fund.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) For purposes of this Subsection, the deposits made to an account by the owner include all deposits of principal made to an education savings account during the calendar year ending December thirty-first of the year on which the earnings enhancement will be based, provided such amount is not more than the projected sum of five times the annual qualified higher education expenses at the highest cost Louisiana public college or university, projected to the scheduled date of the beneficiary's first enrollment into an institution of higher education.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(3)(a) Effective for calendar years beginning January 1, 2001, the earnings enhancement rate applicable to an account established by a person or persons identified in Subparagraph (A)(1)(a) or (b) of this Section shall be determined by the adjusted gross income reported by the owner of the account on his federal tax return for the taxable year immediately preceding the year in which the beneficiary of the account is being considered for an earnings enhancement, according to the following schedule:</p>
