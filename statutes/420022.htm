<p class="PdfParaStyle01">CHAPTER&#160;&#160;1-A. OPEN MEETINGS LAW</p>

<p class="PdfParaStyle04">42:22&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Presentation and consideration of offer to sell natural gas to a public body, or to operate or acquire ownership of, a gas utility owned or operated by a public body</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">A. For the purposes of this Section, "gas utility" means any revenue producing business or organization which is owned or operated by a public body, and which regularly supplies the public with natural gas at retail.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">B. Prior to consideration or action by a public body to accept a proposal by a nonpublic entity to sell natural gas to a public body for use in its gas distribution system sales to retail customers for a term exceeding twelve months including rollovers or extensions, or to assume operation or acquire ownership of, a gas utility being operated or owned by the public body, the proposal shall:</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">(1) Be introduced, in writing, at an open meeting of the public body.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">(2) Not be considered by the public body until notice of the proposal has been published in the official journal of the public body and at least thirty days has lapsed after the introduction of the proposal.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">(3) Include a written report of the most recent five-year history of the sale of natural gas to similar public bodies for use in gas distribution system sales to retail customers for a term exceeding twelve months including rollovers or extensions by the nonpublic entity if the entity is seeking to sell natural gas to a public body for use in its gas distribution system sales to retail customers for a term exceeding twelve months including rollovers or extensions to the public body or a five-year history of the purchase price of other gas utilities operated or owned by a public body paid by the nonpublic entity if the entity is seeking to assume operation or acquire ownership of the utility. A copy of the report shall be provided to all members of the public body and be available to the public.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">(4) Include any written contract or agreement proposed between the nonpublic entity seeking to sell natural gas to a public body for use in its gas distribution system sales to retail customers for a term exceeding twelve months including rollovers or extensions to, or assume operation or acquire ownership of, the gas utility and the public body. A copy of the contract or agreement shall be provided to all members of the public body and be available to the public.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">C. Notice of the proposal and the availability of the written report and contract or agreement shall be published once in the official journal of the public body. The notice shall indicate the time and place where the public body will hold a public hearing and consider the proposal.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">D. No proposal shall be considered until a public hearing on it has been held. No proposal can be adopted at the meeting at which it is introduced.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">E. Any proposed revision or amendment of the published contract or agreement shall be noticed, published, and made available in its entirety in the same manner as required for the original contract or agreement. No such contract or agreement shall be entered into by the public body until at least thirty days have lapsed since the notice of the availability of the revised contract or agreement has been published.</p>
