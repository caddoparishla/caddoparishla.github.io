<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(2) Work as individual schools in developing individual school programs.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(3) Work as groups of high schools in developing various consortia programs.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">B. The following options may be incorporated into school planning to aid in curriculum design:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(1) Four by four block scheduling which allows a total of eight Carnegie units to be earned in each school year.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(2) Coordination of the eight electives already available into a coherent and sequenced career major.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(3) State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education approval for new courses.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(4) Sharing facilities, materials, equipment, and instructors with technical colleges subject to the following:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(a) If students are transported to area technical colleges, each parish school system shall be responsible for the cost of transporting such students.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(b) Other expenses and issues, including liability, involved in sharing resources with technical colleges must be approved by the appropriate school board with subsequent approval by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(5) Organization of new courses in accordance with the appropriate state-adopted career clusters.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(6) Arrangements for students to complete more in-depth study through job shadowing, mentoring, paid or unpaid internships, pre-apprenticeships, registered apprenticeship programs, community service, project learning, school-based enterprises, and early admission to post-secondary education or training.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">C. The faculty for the career major program shall include career and technical instructors and other teachers who have received the appropriate staff development or in-service training to enable them to teach career major courses.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">D. Any teacher chosen to teach an applied course of instruction shall be given appropriate staff development and in-service training.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">E. Whenever an instructor is unavailable to teach a career and technical course, such course may be taught through the aid of technology and computer software.</p>
