<p class="Title">UNSAFE SCHOOL CHOICE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board, as required by federal law, shall permit students attending a persistently dangerous public school, or students who become victims of a violent criminal offense while in or on the grounds of a public school that they attend, to attend a safe public school.&#160;&#160;The State of Louisiana shall notify the School Board each year if any of the schools are identified as <i>unsafe</i>.&#160;&#160;Transfer of any student from a school classified as unsafe shall be in accordance with the following guidelines.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>STUDENTS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF CRIMES OF VIOLENCE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student at a public elementary school, middle school or high school who becomes a victim of a crime of violence, as defined by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a id="id1" href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/140002.htm');return false;" name="id1">14:2</a>, while on school property, on a school bus or at a school-sponsored event, must be given the option to transfer to another public school within Caddo Parish which offers instruction at the student’s grade level and which is not persistently dangerous, if there is such a school within the school district.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student who is enrolled in an alternative school or a special school and who becomes a victim of a crime of violence, as defined by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a id="id2" href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/140002.htm');return false;" name="id2">14:2</a>, while on school property, on a school bus or at a school-sponsored event, must be given the &#160;option to transfer to another such public school within Caddo Parish which offers instruction at the student’s grade-level, for which the student meets the admission requirements and which is not persistently dangerous, if there is such a school within the school district.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>However, a student who has been assigned to a particular school, such as an alternative school or a special school, by court order shall not have the option to transfer.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student who has been the victim of a crime of violence and who must be given the option to transfer should generally be given the option to transfer within ten (10) calendar days from the date on which the crime of violence occurred.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PERSISTENTLY DANGEROUS SCHOOLS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students attending a persistently dangerous public elementary school, middle school or high school shall be given the option to transfer to another public school within Caddo Parish, which offers instruction at the students’ grade level and which is not persistently dangerous, if there is such a school within the school district.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student who is enrolled in an alternative school or a special school which is persistently dangerous must be given the option to transfer to another such public school within the school district, which offers instruction at the student’s grade-level, for which the student meets the admission requirements and which is not persistently dangerous, if there is such a school within the school district.&#160;&#160;However, a student who has been assigned to a particular school, such as an alternative school or a special school, by court order shall not have the option to transfer.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board, in a timely manner, shall notify parents of each student attending the school that the school has been identified as <i>persistently dangerous</i>, offer the students the opportunity to transfer and complete the transfer. &#160;Although timely implementation of these steps depends on the specific circumstances within the school district, students should generally be offered the option to transfer within twenty (20) school days from the time the school district is notified that the school has been identified as <i>persistently dangerous.</i> &#160;Although the transfer may be temporary or permanent, the transfer must remain in effect for at least as long as the school is identified as <i>persistently dangerous</i>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board, once one or more schools have been identified as persistently dangerous schools, must submit a corrective action plan to the Louisiana Department of Education for approval and implement the corrective action. &#160;The School Board shall generally develop a corrective action plan within twenty (20) calendar days from the date the School Board is notified of the need for the corrective action plan.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A school shall not be considered as persistently dangerous if the school no longer meets the identifying criteria.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>INTERDISTRICT AGREEMENTS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Nothing herein shall prohibit school districts from entering into agreements with one another allowing students who become the victims of crimes of violence while on school property, on a school bus, or at a school-sponsored event or who are attending persistently dangerous schools in one school district the option to transfer to a school, which is not persistently dangerous, in another school district.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>However, a student who has been assigned to a particular school, such as an alternative school or a special school, by court order shall not have the option to transfer.</p>
