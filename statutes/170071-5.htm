<p class="PdfParaStyle05">A. By resolution adopted pursuant to R.S. 17:71.4, each school board shall reapportion itself based upon each federal decennial census, or a special census as authorized by R.S. 17:71.3(A). Such resolution shall be adopted on or before December thirty-first of the second year following the year in which the population of this state is reported to the president of the United States for each decennial census, unless an election of the members of the school board is to take place in the second year after reporting of the decennial census, in which case, the resolution is to be adopted no later than March first of the second year after reporting of the decennial census. Reapportionment shall not reduce the term of any member who is then seated and elected. Each board shall submit its reapportionment plan to the United States Department of Justice no later than one hundred twenty days after adoption of the resolution pursuant to R.S. 17:71.4, as required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, Title 42, Section 1973(a) of the United States Code and shall also submit a copy of such resolution by certified mail to the secretary of state.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">B. (1) The provisions of this Subsection shall be applicable only when all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(a) The parish is governed by a home rule charter providing for a consolidated plan of government.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(b) The parish governing authority has reapportioned itself and reduced the number of its members when required to do so pursuant to procedures provided in the home rule charter.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(c) The school board has the same number of members elected from the same districts that the parish governing authority had prior to such parish governing authority reapportionment.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(2) In any such parish, the school board shall reapportion itself when required to do so by the electors of the parish in accordance with the same procedures provided in the parish home rule charter which were used to require that the parish governing authority reapportion itself. For the purposes of this Subsection, the school board shall have the same powers and duties to implement such procedures as are provided in the home rule charter for the parish governing authority. When so required to reapportion, the school board shall adopt the same number of members and the same districts as the parish governing authority.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">C. The implementation of the provisions of Subsection B of this Section shall be contingent upon approval pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">D. (1) The provisions of this Subsection shall be applicable only when all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(a) The parish is governed by a home rule charter.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(b) The parish governing authority consists of seven members as follows:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(i) Five members elected from single-member election districts.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(ii) Two members elected from the parish at large.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(c) The school board has eleven members elected from single-member election districts.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(2) In any such parish, the school board shall reapportion itself when required to do so by the electors of the parish using the procedures provided in the parish home rule charter relative to the initiative and referendum process, including petition and election timelines and other requirements for initiative and referendum as specified in the home rule charter. For the purposes of this Subsection, the school board shall have the same powers and duties to implement such procedures as are provided in the home rule charter for the parish governing authority. When so required to reapportion, the school board shall adopt the same number of members and the same election districts as the parish governing authority.</p>
