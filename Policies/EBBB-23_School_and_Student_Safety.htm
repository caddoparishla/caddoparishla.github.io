<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The Caddo Parish School Board is committed to providing a safe environment for the students and employees of its schools.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall take immediate action to address any potential threats of violence or terrorism to students and employees as required by the <i>Louisiana School and Student Safety Act</i> (La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§17:409.1-17:410).</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The School Board shall develop, in consultation with local law enforcement agencies, age appropriate information regarding internet and cell phone safety and online content that is a potential threat to school safety.&#160;&#160;The information shall include how to recognize and report potential threats to school safety posted on the internet, including but not limited to social media posts.&#160;&#160;This information shall be distributed or explained to school personnel and students at the beginning of each school year, and posted on an easily accessible page of each school’s website, as well as the website of the School Board.&#160;&#160;Such information shall include instruction on how to detect potential threats to school safety, visual examples of possible threats, and the process for reporting such threats.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">DEFINITIONS</span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Risk is imminent</span></i> <span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">means that the available facts, when viewed in light of surrounding circumstances, would cause a reasonable person to believe that the event stated in the threat is about to happen.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">School</span></i> <span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">is as defined by La. Rev. Stat.

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Threat is credible</span></i> <span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">means that the available facts, when viewed in light of surrounding circumstances, would cause a reasonable person to believe that the person communicating the threat actually intends to carry out the threat.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Threat of terrorism</span></i> <span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">means communication, whether oral, visual, or written, including but not limited to electronic mail, letters, notes, social media posts, text messages, blogs, or posts on any social networking website, of any crime of violence that would reasonably cause any student, teacher, principal, or school employee to be in sustained fear for his safety, cause the evacuation of a building, or cause other serious disruption to the operation of a school.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Threat of violence</span></i> <span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">means communication, whether oral, visual, or written, including but not limited to electronic mail, letters, notes, social media posts, text messages, blogs, or posts on any social networking website, of any intent to kill, maim, or cause great bodily harm to a student, teacher, principal, or school employee on school property or at any school function.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">MANDATORY REPORTING</span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Any administrator, teacher, counselor, bus operator, or other school employee, whether full-time or part-time, who learns of a threat of violence or threat of terrorism, whether through oral communication, written communication, or electronic communication, shall immediately report the threat to a local law enforcement and, if the employee is not the school administrator, to the school administrator.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Upon being informed of the threat, the school administrator shall make reasonable efforts to attempt to inform all persons who are targets of the threat and shall take all necessary measures to protect their lives and safety.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The school administrator next shall make reasonable efforts to attempt to notify the appropriate personnel within the School District administration.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The school administrator and the School District administrator then shall determine if risk is imminent for any other persons because of the threat, and if so, notify them and make reasonable efforts to attempt to take measures to protect their lives and safety.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The school administrator and the School District administrator then shall determine whether to notify parents of the students at the school.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">No person shall have a cause of action against any person for any action taken or statement made in adherence with the requirement for reporting as provided herein.&#160;&#160;However, the immunity from liability provided in this policy shall not apply to any action or statement if the action or statement was maliciously, willfully, and deliberately intended to cause harm to, harass, or otherwise deceive law enforcement or school officials.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Reporting Procedures</span></u></p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">A process for allowing school personnel to assist students in completing the standardized form.</span><br />

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">If information reported to a school is deemed a threat the school shall present the form and evidence to local law enforcement agencies.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">If the information poses an immediate threat, school administrators shall follow procedures provided in the school’s <i>Crisis Management and Response Plan</i>.</span></p>

<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Securing any evidence, including but not limited to statements, writings, recordings, electronic messages, and photographs.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">If the investigation results in evidence or information that raises a concern that a threat is credible, the school and School District shall implement measures to provide for ongoing protection of the safety and lives of all students and staff at the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">If the person who is reported to a local law enforcement agency is not a student, he or she shall not be permitted to be within five hundred feet (500’) of any school until he or she has undergone a formal medical or mental health evaluation and has been deemed by a healthcare professional not to be dangerous to himself/herself or others. &#160;After such a determination, the person shall not be permitted in a school unless he has notified the school administrator of his intent to visit the school and he is notified that the administrator has provided at least two (2) school days' notice regarding the visit to anyone in the school who was directly threatened by the person. &#160;The school administrator may deny such person the right&#160;to visit the school.</span></p>
