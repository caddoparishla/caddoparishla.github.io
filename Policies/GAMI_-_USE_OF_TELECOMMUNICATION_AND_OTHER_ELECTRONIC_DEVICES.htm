<p class="Title">USE OF TELECOMMUNICATION AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>TELECOMMUNICATION DEVICES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees shall be prohibited from using electronic telecommunication devices such as personal cellular telephones, pagers, beepers or other such devices during the workday unless otherwise authorized or upon prior approval of their immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees may use such communication devices during breaks or in emergency situations.&#160;&#160;<i>Emergency</i> means an actual or imminent threat to public health or safety which may result in the loss of life, injury, or property damage.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above provisions, this policy shall not affect the conduct of law enforcement activities including the use of electronic detection devices, dogs or other means of conducting searches for weapons, drugs, or other contraband in whatever manner is otherwise permitted by law and consistent with School Board policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Exceptions</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>School administrators and supervisors may be permitted to carry cell phones in sight due to administrative and safety responsibilities.&#160;&#160;It is suggested that the phone be in the vibrate mode and used out of the sight of students whenever possible.&#160;&#160;No personal use of the cell phone is allowed except as provided above for the teachers and staff.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>EMPLOYER PROVIDED CELLULAR PHONES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board may provide cell phones to selected employees to ensure the safety of the educational community and school clientele, as well as to enhance all facets of school operations and procedures to improve the efficiency of the district.&#160;&#160;The Superintendent shall designate those employees who may be issued cell phones, based on the employees’ duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Cell phones are not a personal benefit, nor a primary mode of personal communication. &#160;Cell phones must be used for school-related business <b>only</b>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>School Board personnel shall monitor use of the School Board-owned cell phones for propriety and reasonableness of phone use.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ELECTRONIC RECORDING DEVICES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>No employee of the Caddo Parish School Board shall utilize an electronic recording device to surreptitiously record a telephone or face-to-face conversation with any other person while the employee is on duty or where the communication concerns school matters.&#160;&#160;To ensure compliance with this policy, and to protect the privacy rights of the individual who is subject to the use of a recording device, a school employee shall, prior to the initiation or use of any recording device to monitor a conversation with a third party, advise the third party that the conversation is being recorded and shall request the permission of the third party to record the conversation, which advice and consent for the recordation shall be documented at the beginning of the recordation of any such conversation.&#160;&#160;If permission to record is denied by the third party, no employee shall surreptitiously record a conversation with any third party.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This policy shall have no application to the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>A recording made at the direct request and in conjunction with a member of a law enforcement agency pursuant to the investigation of criminal conduct by that agency;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recording made to preserve a criminal threat of personal injury or property damage by a third party, i.e. a bomb threat or threat to physically harm a teacher, student or other person;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due process hearings for employees or students where recordation of the proceedings is required by state law or School Board policy, such as student suspension or expulsion hearings at the Superintendent level, or teacher tenure hearings before the School Board.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>CONTACTING SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees shall only contact School Board members utilizing email account(s), mailing addresses, or phone number(s) designated by the Caddo Parish School Board member and maintained at the main office.&#160;&#160;School Board members’ official contact information and district supported emails which allow everyone to email individual School Board members shall also be posted on the School Board’s website. &#160;Blocking of contact information by employees, or School Board members shall not be permitted.&#160;&#160;Nothing in this policy shall prohibit individual School Board members from providing other means by which employees may contact them or from personally speaking to employees.&#160;&#160;Nothing in this policy shall prohibit administration from prohibiting spam or mass emails that inhibits the effective utilization of the email system.</p>
