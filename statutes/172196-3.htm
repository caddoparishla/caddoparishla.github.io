Pledges of the avails of the corporation franchise tax for payment of the outstanding bonds issued pursuant to Act 166 of the Regular Session of 1934, as amended by Act 72 of the Regular Session of 1936, and Act 4 of the Regular Session of 1938, Act No. 6 of the Regular Session of 1938, and Act No. 54 of 1950 are given full faith and effect hereunder, and such bonds and pledges are hereinafter called "prior bonds and pledges." Prior bonds and pledges include $20,000,000 additional bonds authorized by Act No. 97 of the 1966 Legislature, above referred to, provided, however, no new or additional bonds shall be issued, nor pledges or committals shall be made in the future which shall constitute a bond or pledge within the meaning of prior bonds and pledges as herein defined, nor shall any future bonds be issued secured by a pledge of corporation franchise tax which is superior to or on a arity with the lien and pledge of corporation franchise tax securing bonds authorized under this SubPart. Proceeds of corporation franchise tax remaining after payment of all sums required to be made for prior bonds and pledges are irrevocably pledged and dedicated to the payment of bonds herein authorized to be issued, and said tax avails to the extent necessary to pay principal, interest and reserve requirements, if any, on outstanding bonds issued under this SubPart shall be remitted directly by the state treasurer to issuing board. No part of any appropriation by the Legislature out of the General Fund of the State of Louisiana shall be applied to the payment of said bonds or other obligations, or the interest thereon, or any part or portion thereof. This R.S. 17:2196.1 to 17:2196.7 shall not be construed as repealing any part of Act No. 166 of the Regular Session of 1934, as amended by Act No. 72 of the Regular Session of 1936, or any part of Act No. 4 of the Regular Session of 1938, or any part of Act No. 6 of the Regular Session of 1938, or any part of Act 54 of the Regular Session of 1950, but is additional and supplemental thereto.</p>
