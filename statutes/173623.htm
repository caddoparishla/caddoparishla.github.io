<p class="PdfParaStyle03">PART II. PROFESSIONAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle03">SUBPART B. PROFESSIONAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle03">&#160;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle04">17:3623 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Program development</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;A. Each participating teacher shall submit to his local committee, in writing, a professional improvement program plan for five years, which shall be based on his needs as determined through self evaluation of career needs and interests as determined in conjunction with the local committee. Each plan shall indicate as specifically as possible the activities intended to be pursued, the time for completion, and the goals to be reached. Each plan shall be subdivided into one-year increments and shall contain an estimate by the teacher of the number of PIPS each activity should be awarded.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;B. (1) Each city and parish school superintendent may submit to his local committee, in writing, recommendations relative to the types of subject matter area courses and in-service training that, based on his assessment of the overall needs of the teachers in his school system, would most benefit those teachers in fulfilling the purposes of this program as provided in R.S. 17:3601.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(2) Each local committee shall review the recommendations submitted to it by the local city or parish school superintendent pursuant to this Subsection and may consider such recommendations if they are in compliance with state law and state committee guidelines.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;C. Each submitted plan shall be reviewed, evaluated, and if necessary, modified by the local committee which shall assign the number of PIPS to be awarded for each activity planned as determined by the state committee in accordance with R.S. 17:3613(3). The local committee shall require that the total PIPS planned to be earned in each five-year plan is the number required by the state committee.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;D. Each participant may modify his plan during the five years with the approval of the local committee if such modification does not reduce the total number of PIPS required to be earned for successful completion of the program. A participant who transfers from one public school system to another may continue to follow the plan approved by the local committee in the system from which the transfer was made.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;E. No participant shall include in his plan any course or seminar he has previously undertaken and successfully completed; however, participants on Substance Abuse Prevention Education teams, as provided under R.S. 17:3622(C)(6), may receive PIPS for continued participation on such teams for a period not to exceed three years.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle08">Added by Acts 1980, No. 207, Sec. 1, eff. July 1, 1981. Amended by Acts 1981, No. 337, Sec. 1, eff. July 15, 1981; Acts 1982, No. 433, Sec. 1, eff. July 21, 1982; Acts 1983, No. 505, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1984.</p>
