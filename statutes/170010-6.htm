<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-autospace: none;">(b) As provided in this Section as well as under his authority as provided in R.S. 24:513(A)(4) and pursuant to any of the circumstances outlined therein, the legislative auditor may take any of the following steps:</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">(i) Conduct an independent audit of the finances and financial practices of the local board.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">(ii) Investigate the response of the superintendent to the audit conducted by the independent licensed certified public accountant.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">(iii) Require that the local board contract with a licensed certified public accountant, other than the one who did the audit, from a list of not less than three such accountants submitted to the board by the superintendent to direct the changes in the local system financial practices necessary to address each audit finding.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">(3) Expenses incurred by the legislative auditor shall be reimbursed by the local system.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">(4) If the audit reveals irregularities including conduct which may be criminal in nature, such irregularities shall be reported to the district attorney with jurisdiction in the parish in which the school district is located or the appropriate United States attorney when irregularities are revealed which may be a violation of federal law.</p>

<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">G. If found to be academically in crisis, a local system shall remain so until the academic performance of the students in the system has improved sufficiently to improve the school performance sufficiently that the system is no longer defined as academically in crisis and the system has an unqualified audit opinion, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, on the annual independent audit report required by Subsection E of this Section.</p>
