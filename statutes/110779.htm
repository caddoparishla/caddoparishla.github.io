<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) In addition to the benefit provided by Paragraph (1) of this Subsection, if a disability retiree has a minor child, the disability retiree shall be paid an added benefit equal to fifty percent of his disability benefit for so long as he has a minor child, provided that the total benefit payable to the disability retiree does not exceed seventy-five percent of his average compensation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>C.
