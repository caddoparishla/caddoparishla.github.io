<p class="Title">COMPUTER AND NETWORK ACCEPTABLE USE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board shall provide employees and students with access to the school district’s electronic communication system. &#160;<i>Electronic communication system</i> shall be defined as the school district’s hardware and software components necessary to achieve connectivity and communicate between telephones, servers and workstations, the application programs that reside on those servers and workstations that are executed by users, the files created by those application programs or users, the files downloaded or copied by users, the Internet and or any other networks accessed via the school district’s electronic communication system which shall be referred to as the <i>Caddo Public Schools Network</i> (CPSN).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Network resources shall be provided for educational purposes and to carry out the legitimate business of the school district. &#160;The term <i>educational purposes</i> includes classroom activities and assignments, directed student research, interpersonal communication, professional development, collaborative projects, and dissemination of successful educational practices, methods, and materials.&#160;&#160;The School Board expects all employees, students, School Board members, and any other users, who use computing and network resources of the School Board, including electronic mail and telecommunications tools, to apply them in appropriate ways to the performance of responsibilities associated with their positions and assignments.&#160;&#160;The School Board directs the Superintendent or authorized designee(s) to specify those behaviors that are permitted and those that are not permitted as well as disseminate appropriate guidelines for the use of technology resources.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-underline: black;">INTERNET SAFETY</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In compliance with the <i>Children’s Internet Protection Act</i>, the School Board shall use a technology protection measure that blocks and/or filters Internet access to Internet sites which contain harmful materials or information, such as sites that contain obscene, pornographic, pervasively vulgar, excessively violent, or sexually harassing material or information, or sites that may contain information on the manufacturing of bombs or incendiary devices. &#160;The technology protection measure that blocks and/or filters Internet access may be disabled by an authorized individual for bona fide research purposes with the permission of the Superintendent or authorized designee(s). &#160;This disabling is permissible only for a student seventeen (17) years of age or older or an authorized employee for the purpose as stated.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The network and Internet user shall be held responsible for his/her actions and activities. &#160;Responsibilities include efficient, ethical and legal utilization of network resources.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>As a matter of public law, any document pertaining to the public business on a publicly funded system is a public record, and this law applies to records stored on district computers.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-underline: black;">INTERNET USAGE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any use of the Internet that adversely affects its operation in pursuit of teaching and learning or jeopardizes its use or performance for other community members is prohibited and may result in loss of Internet privileges, suspension or other appropriate disciplinary action.&#160;&#160;The provisions of this policy shall also apply to the use of private e-mail accounts when access is attained using School Board equipment or networks and to access attained through any authorized personal digital device while on School Board property. &#160;The Caddo Parish School Board does not condone the use of the Internet for any illegal or inappropriate activities and shall not be responsible for any such use by staff or students.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-underline: black;">ACCOUNTABILITY</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Faculty and staff use of school computers or the Internet shall be reserved for educational purposes and the conducting of business aspects of the school system. &#160;All personnel using school computers or a computer network located on school property, or computers accessing the Internet shall be accountable for their use. &#160;Teacher or class files on the network shall be treated as school district property subject to control and inspection by School Board personnel. &#160;Access codes or passwords shall be kept on file in a secured location by the principal or his/her designee in case an inspection is warranted. &#160;Use of the Internet, the CPSN, and/or any computers shall be considered a privilege and any inappropriate use may result in appropriate disciplinary action and loss of privileges to use the CPSN and computers.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board does not condone any illegal or inappropriate activities and shall not be responsible for such use by staff. &#160;The School Board does not guarantee the right to use the Internet and reserves the right to suspend or terminate the privilege of any individual at its sole discretion without notice, cause, or reason. &#160;Failure to adhere to these regulations may result in the loss of computer privileges, access to the Internet and electronic mail account and may result in further disciplinary action up to and including termination. &#160;Furthermore, any activity that may be in violation of local, state, or federal laws shall be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Access to the information resources infrastructure, sharing of information, and security of intellectual products, all require that each and every user accept responsibility to protect the rights of the community. &#160;Any materials or files, such as, but not limited to, lesson plans, schedules, letters, memos, documents, programs, spreadsheets, databases, and/or presentations created with Caddo Parish School Board equipment and/or facilities, or during periods for which the employee is compensated by the School Board becomes the intellectual property of Caddo Parish School Board. &#160;Any employee of the School Board who, without authorization, accesses, uses, destroys, alters, dismantles or disfigures any School Board information technologies, properties or facilities, including those owned by third parties, thereby threatens the atmosphere of increased access and sharing of information, threatens the security within which members of the CPSN may create intellectual products and maintain records, and has engaged in unethical and unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Users shall be responsible for the content of e-mail messages in their account. &#160;Communications on the CPSN should be viewed as public in nature.&#160;&#160;E-mail is not a confidential medium for transmitting personal messages. &#160;School Board administrators may at any time review communications to maintain integrity system-wide and ensure that staff members are using the system responsibly. &#160;The School Board shall have access to all e-mail, which may be routinely and randomly checked. &#160;Inappropriate or profane messages, as well as messages that disrupt the educational and administrative goals of the School Board may result in loss of privileges and/or disciplinary action. &#160;Messages relating to, or in support of, illegal activities may be reported to the appropriate authorities. &#160;The School Board shall cooperate fully with any local, state, or federal officials in any investigation concerning or relating to any mail transmitted on School Board computers.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Accordingly:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>E-mail shall not be left on the server. &#160;Users shall be expected to remove old messages on their computers in a timely fashion (monthly) and School Board administrators shall be authorized to remove such messages if not attended to regularly and properly by the user.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-underline: black;">UNAUTHORIZED AND ILLEGAL USE</u></p>

<p>Tampering with selection menus, procedures, or icons for the purpose of misleading or confusing other users shall be prohibited. &#160;Any use by any person of the CPSN that incurs expenses to the school other than the monthly user fees and rates shall be strictly prohibited. &#160;Furthermore, the computer system shall not be used for commercial, political or religious purposes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Use of the CPSN for any illegal activities shall also be prohibited. Illegal activities may include but are not limited to: &#160;(a) tampering with computer hardware or software, (b) unauthorized entry into computers and files (hacking), (c) knowledgeable vandalism or destruction of equipment, and (d) deletion of computer files. &#160;Such activity is considered a crime under state and federal law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-underline: black;">SECURITY</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Teachers and other personnel who have computers in their charge shall be responsible for the security of those computers in terms of both hardware and software.&#160;&#160;Computers must be secured such that students acting without the consent or supervision of a teacher or administrator cannot enter the network or access the Internet.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees should not allow others to have access to or use their e-mail accounts or disclose their, or others’ passwords. &#160;All employee passwords shall be on file with the employee’s immediate supervisor. &#160;Should a password be changed, the employee shall notify their supervisor immediately.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employee’s e-mail accounts shall not be readily accessible by students.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>STUDENT USE OF VIRTUAL PLATFORM</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When the classroom environment is virtual (online), the standards of behavior are as important as they are in brick and mortar schools. &#160;In other words, our virtual classrooms are real classrooms with real teachers; therefore, appropriate student behavior is expected.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Students should address all faculty and staff members as adults with the courtesy expected for education professionals. &#160;Students are to use both the appropriate title (Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Dr.) and last name only. &#160;No other form of address is acceptable.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should phrase communications with faculty and staff in a polite and courteous manner appropriate for speaking to adults.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are not to use obscene, profane, threatening, or disrespectful language or images in any communications on the virtual platform.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students must not record the virtual classroom or student content without approval of the teacher. &#160;Learning platforms and content are proprietary and copyrighted. &#160;Reposting of classroom discussions on any other platform is strictly prohibited unless authorized by the teacher who must receive the appropriate authorizations to disclose the content.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All communications with other students enrolled in the virtual platform must be of a course-related nature. &#160;Any sending of unsolicited email to other classmates is prohibited.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All communications with other students in any forum, course related email, discussion post, etc., must be polite, courteous and respectful.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The integrity and authenticity of student work is important. &#160;Copying the work of others, allowing others to knowingly copy a student’s work, and/or misusing content from the Internet could result in a failing grade.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not collaborate (work with) with other students on your assignments unless directed to do so by your teacher. &#160;Working together is useful in the traditional classroom, but it is not permitted in the online environment without specific teacher instructions to do so. &#160;In addition, parents may not login to a student account and complete coursework on behalf of the student.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are not to use obscene, profane, threatening, or disrespectful language or images in any communications with other students.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are subject to all local, state, and federal laws governing the Internet. &#160;Consequently, program administrators will cooperate fully with local, state, or federal officials in any investigation related to illegal activities conducted through Internet access.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event there is a claim that a student has violated this policy, he/she will be notified of the suspected violation and given an opportunity to present an explanation.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any student that violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action that may result in disciplinary or legal action</p>
