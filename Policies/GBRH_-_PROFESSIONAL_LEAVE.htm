<p class="Title">PROFESSIONAL LEAVE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board recognizes the value of attending regional and national educational meetings in order to become exposed to new ideas and developments in various areas of public school education.&#160;&#160;Therefore, the Superintendent or his/her designee may grant professional leave to an employee wishing to attend any educationally related conference, meeting, or convention, if such attendance is considered to be in the best interests of the school district.&#160;&#160;The School Board may pay all or any part of expenses of any personnel whom it may direct to represent it at any such professional or educational meeting or in visitation to another school system.&#160;&#160;In all such cases, prior approval for said expenses must be given by the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Application and notification to attend a conference or similar educational meeting shall be made in writing and approved as far in advance of the meeting as possible.&#160;&#160;The written request shall include dates, subjects to be covered, and sponsoring agency.&#160;&#160;Employees may also request or be directed by their supervisor to attend a meeting, workshop or other work related activity.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees granted professional leave shall be expected to fully participate in the conference or educational meetings for which leave is granted.&#160;&#160;The employee may also be required to submit proper documentation that the leave granted was used for the purposes for which requested.&#160;&#160;&#160;Any instances of non-attendance shall be reported to the employee’s supervisor.&#160;&#160;Such non-attendance may result in reimbursement to the School Board of any compensation paid the employee for the leave days taken, and may lead to discipline of the employee up to and including termination.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SCHOOL DISTRICT MEETINGS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees shall attend in-service meetings in the school district during the workday on the recommendation of the department head and as authorized by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>STATE MEETINGS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees may be permitted to attend workshops and/or in-service meetings in the state during the work day with the recommendation of the principal/department head and the authorization of the Superintendent, provided such meetings are related to the performance of the employee’s job assignment.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>LEAVE FOR STATE BOARD OR COMMISSION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Leave with pay shall be granted any school system employee who is an elected member of the Board of Trustees of the <i>Teachers’ Retirement System of Louisiana</i> or the <i>Louisiana School Employees Retirement System</i>, an elected or appointed member of the <i>Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education</i> (BESE), or an appointed member of any task force, commission, or other advisory body established by BESE so that such employee may attend meetings of the entity and any committees thereof on which the employee serves.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall require any employees who may serve on the public entities outlined above to provide notice to the School Board of the dates and times of all meetings of the entity and any committees thereof that are scheduled to occur on a regular basis and reasonable notice to the School Board of any special or otherwise unscheduled meetings.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any employee serving on such an entity shall apply in writing for such leave in a timely manner, but in no case less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the date of the meeting, except in an emergency.&#160;&#160;The employee shall also be required to submit proper documentation that the leave granted was used for the purposes for which requested.&#160;&#160;Improper use of said leave may result in reimbursement to the School Board of any compensation paid the employee for the leave days taken, and may lead to discipline of the employee up to and including termination.</p>
