<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(4) A plain and concise statement of facts and circumstances showing reasonable grounds to believe that the family is in need of services and that the child's conduct or surroundings are such as to endanger his welfare, and that immediate removal appears to be necessary for his protection or control.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(5) A statement indicating whether the child was released or conducted to a shelter care facility.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">E. If the child is released pursuant to Paragraph B of this Article, the report shall be submitted by the officer within seven days from the child's release.
