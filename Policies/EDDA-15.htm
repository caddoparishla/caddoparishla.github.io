<p class="Title">SPECIAL USE OF SCHOOL BUSES</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It shall be the policy of the Caddo Parish School Board to permit the use of school buses for student trips or excursions to enhance instructional activities. &#160;The use of buses for such trips shall be strictly governed by administrative regulations and procedures maintained by the Superintendent or administrative staff. &#160;All arrangements for any trip or excursion shall be made by the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any school or organization may use buses for athletic or activity trips. &#160;The School Board shall be reimbursed by the school or organization the expense equal to the cost of operation of the buses for the particular event. &#160;The bus operator shall provide proof of appropriate insurance coverage prior to any trip being taken if using an approved bus not owned or leased by the School Board. &#160;In addition, the following guidelines shall also apply to the special use of any school bus:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>For activities of an educational nature within the parish, the use of the buses shall be requested by the principal of the school involved and such usage shall be limited in time so as not to interfere with the regular route to which that bus is assigned.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For educational activities outside the parish, the use of the buses shall be limited to transporting those students who are engaged in representing their school in the principal activity for which the trip is required. &#160;The request shall also come from the principal involved.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approval for the use of the buses shall be requested at a time prior to the trip sufficient for the office staff to evaluate the request and to make the arrangements necessary. All buses on all occasions shall be driven by a person with a commercial driver's license. &#160;The principal of the school involved shall be held responsible for seeing that the above condition is met.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-underline: black;">NON-SCHOOL RELATED BUS USAGE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Because of legal constraints and insurance requirements, the School Board may permit limited use of school buses by outside nonprofit organizations for trips to and from Caddo Parish Public Schools for instructional purposes only, upon application to and approval by the School Board. &#160;An <i>instructional purpose</i> shall be defined as one that enhances and/or reinforces classroom instruction. &#160;A <i>nonprofit organization</i> shall be defined as an organization not conducted or maintained for the purpose to make a profit.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The application shall state the date(s) of the usage, the purpose, destination, and number of participants and shall release the School Board from any expense or liability based on said usage. &#160;The application shall be signed by a legal representative of the group or organization and submitted at least thirty (30) days prior to the intended date of usage. &#160;The presence and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages on the bus shall be expressly prohibited. &#160;Fees for usage of buses shall be assessed the organization and cannot be waived.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Only Caddo Parish School Board operators shall be allowed to drive buses on such trips.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
