<p class="PdfParaStyle01">TITLE 17. EDUCATION</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle02">CHAPTER 2. TEACHERS AND EMPLOYEES</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle03">PART I. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle03">&#160;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle04" style="margin-left: 78px; text-indent: -78px;">17:416.9 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Schools' duty as to safety; imminent danger to teachers; inspection; restraining order; other relief</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;A. Each city or parish school board shall furnish to each teacher a place of employment free from recognized dangers or hazards that are causing or likely to cause serious injury or death to its teachers.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;B. (1) Any teacher or representative of a teacher who reasonably and in good faith believes that an imminent danger to such teacher exists may request the principal of his school to investigate and resolve the situation. If the teacher remains unsatisfied with the response to his request, he may request the superintendent of the system where the teacher is employed to cause an inspection of such teacher's school to occur. The superintendent shall notify the school board and shall undertake to resolve the situation within six months from the request.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(2) If the situation has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the teacher requesting the inspection, the teacher may request the state superintendent of education to cause an inspection of such teacher's school to occur. Such request shall be directed to the superintendent or his authorized representative and shall provide notice of any perceived danger. Any such request shall be reduced to writing, shall set forth with reasonable particularity the grounds for the request, and shall be signed by the teacher or his representative. A copy of the request shall be provided to the principal of the school not later than the time of inspection as ordered by the state superintendent. Upon the request of the person making request for inspection, any copies of the request shall delete his name and the names of any individual teachers referred to therein.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;C. If upon receipt of such request the state superintendent or his authorized representative determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an inspection is warranted, he shall make an inspection of such school as soon as practicable, to determine if danger exists. If the superintendent or his authorized representative determines there are no reasonable grounds to believe that danger exists, he shall notify the principal of the school and the teacher or his representative in writing of such determination.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;D. If upon inspection, the state superintendent or his authorized representative determines that an imminent danger exists from which there is a reasonable probability that serious injury or death could result to any teacher, the superintendent or his authorized representative may issue an order to the city or parish school board immediately restraining any such condition, practice, method, process, or means in the school. Any order issued under this Subsection may require the city or parish school board to take such steps as may be necessary to avoid, correct or remove such danger and prohibit the employment or presence of any teacher in locations or under conditions where such danger exists.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;E. Whenever the state superintendent or his authorized representative determines that a condition, practice, method, process, or means described in Subsection D of this Section exists in any school, he shall promptly inform the requesting teacher and the principal of the danger.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;F. At any time that an order restraining any condition, practice, method, process, or means described in Subsection D of this Section is issued by the state superintendent or his authorized representative, he may in addition request the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to make an application to the district court of the parish wherein such condition, practice, method, process, or means exists for a temporary restraining order or such other relief as appears to be appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;G. In addition to and after having invoked the powers of restraint vested in the state superintendent as provided in Subsection D of this Section, the district courts of this state shall have jurisdiction upon petition of the superintendent and the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to enjoin any condition, practice, method, process, or means in any school from which there is a reasonable probability that serious injury or death could result to any teacher. Any order issued under this Subsection may require such steps to be taken as may be necessary to avoid, correct or remove such danger and prohibit the employment or presence of any teacher in locations or under conditions where such danger exists.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;H. For purposes of this Section, "teacher" means any teacher or instructor, administrator, staff person, or employee of any public elementary or secondary school.</p>
