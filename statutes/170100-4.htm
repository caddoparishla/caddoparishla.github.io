<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. (1) Each city and parish school board shall adopt rules, regulations, and policies necessary to establish a grievance procedure that shall guarantee a fair hearing on grievances by any teacher or group of teachers or other school employee or group of employees employed by such school board. However, prior to the adoption of the rules, regulations, and policies, each school board shall consult with the various professional organizations that represent the teachers or other school employees in that school system regarding the grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(2) The grievance procedure required by this Section shall provide for a fair and objective resolution of complaints by any teacher or group of teachers or other school employee or group of school employees.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. In establishing a grievance procedure, each city and parish school board shall allow for representation in all aspects of the grievance, except for the procedure provided for in Paragraph C(1) of this Section, and in any school board action on the grievance by the teacher or group of teachers or other school employee or group of school employees voicing the grievance or by a representative or representatives of their choosing.</p>

<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(3) If the grievant or group of grievants is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance by the school system superintendent or his designee, the grievant or group of grievants may request in writing a full hearing before the superintendent or his designee on the grievance. Upon receipt of such written request, the superintendent or his designee shall conduct a full hearing on the grievance, maintain a transcript of the proceedings, and make a written recommendation for disposition of the grievance and provide a copy of the transcript to the school board at a meeting of the board. The board then shall dispose of the grievance.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;D. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section or any other provision of law to the contrary, each city and parish school board may, in negotiating contracts with teachers, or other employees amend its rules, regulations, and policies relative to grievance procedures.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;E. This Section shall not be inferred in any manner to require nor shall the provisions of this Section be construed in any manner to constitute collective bargaining.</p>
