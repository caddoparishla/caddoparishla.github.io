PART III. DEPOSIT AND EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS</p>

<p class="PdfParaStyle04" style="text-indent: -84px; margin-left: 84px;">33:2922 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dedication of revenues; contracts dedicating future revenues; limitations; jail construction contracts</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. The annual revenues of any political subdivision (which term shall mean those units of local government listed in Subsection 2 of &gt; Section 44 of Article VI of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974) shall be dedicated as follows: first, all statutory charges shall be paid from the respective funds upon which they are imposed; second, all charges for services rendered annually under time contracts; third, all necessary and usual charges provided for by ordinance or resolution. Any excess of revenue above such statutory, necessary and usual charges may be applied to the payments of amounts due and unpaid out of the revenues of former years. Any parish, municipal corporation, and any other political subdivision having the prior approval of the governing authority which created it may make in any year, contracts or other obligations dedicating in whole or in part the excess of annual revenues of subsequent years above such statutory, necessary and usual charges. No such contract or obligation shall have any longer term fixed for payment than ten years from the date of the contract or obligation. No dedication of future revenues shall be made which, alone or with other prior dedications in force, exceeds the estimated excess of revenues over the statutory, necessary and usual charges of the year in which the contract or obligation is made. This Section shall not be construed to prohibit any political subdivision from providing by ordinance or resolution for the expenditure of funds derived from miscellaneous or contingent sources actually collected, subject to the dedication of such funds established by law.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of R.S. 33:2922(A), a police jury by entering into reimbursement contracts with the state may dedicate a portion of the general revenue fund of the parish for a term not exceeding twenty-five years from the date of such contracts for the construction and/or renovation of jail facilities.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(2) Any such construction and/or renovation contracts shall be subject to the approval of the State Bond Commission, the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Criminal Justice, and the Division of Administration.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;C. The governing authority of Caddo Parish is hereby authorized to make in any year contracts or other obligations dedicating in whole or in part the excess of annual revenues of subsequent years above statutory, necessary, and usual charges. No such contract or obligation hereunder shall have any longer term fixed for payment than twenty years from the date of the contract or obligation. No dedication of future revenues hereunder shall be made which, alone or with other prior dedications in force, exceeds the estimated excess of revenues over the statutory, necessary, and usual charges of the year in which the contract or obligation is made.</p>
