<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">F. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to affect the purposes for which the proceeds of any sales tax authorized or levied prior to the effective date of this Section shall be used, and the disposition of the proceeds of sales taxes heretofore authorized or levied by the Assumption Parish School Board shall be made in accordance with the authorization under which such tax was levied and is being collected.</p>
