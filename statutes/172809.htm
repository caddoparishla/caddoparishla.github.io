<p class="PdfParaStyle02">CHAPTER 15. EDUCATIONAL COOPERATIVE LAW</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle02">&#160;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle04" style="margin-left: 72px; text-indent: -72px;">17:2809 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Membership; annual meeting; special meetings; place of meeting; notice; quorum; voting</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;A. No person who is not an incorporator shall become or remain a member of a cooperative unless such person is the parent, tutor or guardian of, or the person standing in loco parents to, a child or children using the educational services or facilities furnished by the cooperative or a child or children who have used such facilities within the preceding two years. The bylaws may provide that any person, including an incorporator, shall cease to be a member thereof, unless a child or children of whom he is the parent, tutor or guardian, or the person standing in loco parentis, makes use of the educational services or facilities of the cooperative within a specified time after such person has become a member thereof.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;B. An annual meeting of the members shall be held at such time as provided in the bylaws.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;C. Special meetings of the members shall be called by the board of directors, by any three directors, by not less than ten per centum of the members, or by the president.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;D. Meetings of members shall be held at such place as may be provided in the bylaws. In the absence of any such provision, all meetings shall be held in the city or town in which the principal office of the cooperative is located.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;E. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, written or printed notice stating the time and place of each meeting of members and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given to each member, either personally or by mail, not less than ten or more than twenty-five days before the date of the meeting.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;F. Five per centum of all members, present in person, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the members, unless the bylaws prescribe the presence of a greater percentage of the members for a quorum. If less than a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of those present in person may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;G. Each member shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting. Voting shall be in person, but, if the bylaws so provide, may also be by proxy or by mail, or both. If the bylaws provide for voting by proxy or by mail, they shall also prescribe the conditions under which proxy or mail voting shall be exercised. In any event, only members may act as proxies and no member may act as proxy for more than three members at any meeting of the members.</p>
