<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(2) Benefits shall cease upon remarriage and shall resume upon a subsequent divorce or death of a new spouse; however, if the member was eligible to retire on the date of his death, benefits shall not cease upon remarriage.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(3) Whenever all surviving children cease to be eligible for benefits under Subsection C hereof, the surviving spouse shall cease to receive benefits provided by this Subsection and thereafter, if eligible, shall receive benefits in accordance with the provisions of Subsection D hereof.</p>

Benefits for a child shall cease when the child is no longer a minor child as defined by this Chapter. No surviving minor child shall receive more than one survivor's benefit at any one time.

Each survivor benefit recipient shall be required to establish proof annually or at such other times as the board of trustees may deem necessary that they are still legally entitled to the survivor benefits provided in this Section. The board of trustees shall have the right to suspend or cancel any survivor benefit wherein the recipient fails to provide proper certification of eligibility.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">F. The accumulated contributions of a deceased member shall be paid in a lump sum refund to the natural person or persons that he designated as his beneficiary, or to his succession if there is no designated beneficiary, but only if no benefits under Subsection A, B, C, D, H, or I of this Section are payable.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">G. Payment of accumulated contributions shall be made only upon receipt of the deceased member's death certificate. Said payment to the named beneficiary or the estate cancels all liability of the system to the deceased member, his named beneficiary or his estate.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">H. In the event of death of a member leaving a surviving spouse and dependent children, the total of the benefits payable under Subsections B and C of this Section shall not be less each month than what would have been payable under Subsection D of this Section for as long as both spouse and children are eligible to receive benefits under Subsection B and C of this Section.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">I. If a member dies, even after retirement, eligible minor children shall receive the benefits under Subsection C of this Section.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">J. The benefits payable under Subsection C of this Section shall be paid to the person having legal custody of the property of the child, except in those cases when a trust created under Louisiana law has been created by the deceased member for the benefit of the child, the terms of the instrument creating the trust so provide and the system has been provided with a certified copy of the trust document, then the survivor benefit shall be paid to the trust under the terms of the trust for addition to the trust property. In the event that the trust is contested by any party, the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana shall withhold all survivor benefit payments or deposit them in the registry of the court if a concursus proceeding is filed, until there is a final binding legal agreement or judgement regarding the proper payment of the survivor benefits.</p>
