<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">B. No notice is required under Subsection A if the giving of such notice is precluded by military necessity or, under all of the relevant circumstances, the giving of such notice is otherwise impossible or unreasonable.&#160;&#160;A determination of military necessity for the purposes of this Subsection shall be made pursuant to regulations prescribed by the uniformed services and shall not be subject to judicial review.</span></p>

Subsection A shall apply to a person who is absent from a position of employment by reason of service in the uniformed services if such person's cumulative period of service in the uniformed services, with respect to the employer relationship for which a person seeks reemployment, does not exceed five years, except that any such period of service shall not include any service:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">D. (1) An employer is not required to reemploy a person under this Part if:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(a) The employer's circumstances have so changed as to make such reemployment impossible or unreasonable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(b) Such employment would impose an undue hardship on the employer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(c) The employment from which the person leaves to serve in the uniformed services is for a brief, nonrecurrent period and there is no reasonable expectation that such employment will continue indefinitely or for a significant period.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(2) The employer shall have the burden of proving the impossibility or unreasonableness, undue hardship, or the brief or nonrecurrent nature of the employment without a reasonable expectation of continuing indefinitely or for a significant period.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">E. (1) Subject to Paragraph (2), a person referred to in Subsection A shall, upon the completion of a period of service in the uniformed services, notify the employer referred to in such Subsection of the person's intent to return to a position of employment with such employer as follows:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(i) Not later than the beginning of the first full regularly scheduled work period on the first full calendar day following the completion of the period of service and the expiration of eight hours after a period allowing for the safe transportation of the person from the place of that service to the person's residence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(ii) As soon as possible after the expiration of the eight-hour period referred to in Item (i), if reporting within that period is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the person.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(b) In the case of a person who is absent from a position of employment for a period of any length for the purposes of an examination to determine the person's fitness to perform service in the uniformed services, by reporting in the manner and time referred to in Subparagraph (a).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(c) In the case of a person whose period of service in the uniformed services was for more than thirty days but less than one hundred eighty-one days, by notifying the employer in writing of the intent to return to a position of employment with the employer not later than fourteen days after the completion of the period of service or if submitting such written notice within such period is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the person, the next first full calendar day when submission of such written notice becomes possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(d) In the case of a person whose period of service in the uniformed services was for more than one hundred eighty days, by notifying the employer in writing of the intent to return to a position of employment with the employer not later than ninety days after the completion of the period of service.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(2)(a) A person who is hospitalized for, or convalescing from, an illness or injury incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of service in the uniformed services shall, at the end of the period that is necessary for the person to recover from such illness or injury, report to the person's employer (in the case of a person described in Subparagraph (a) or (b) of Paragraph (1)) or submit written notice to such employer (in the case of a person described in Subparagraph (c) or (d) of such Paragraph).&#160;&#160;Except as provided in Subparagraph (b), such period of recovery may not exceed two years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(b) Such two-year period shall be extended by the minimum time required to accommodate the circumstances beyond such person's control which make reporting within the period specified in Subparagraph (a) impossible or unreasonable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(3) A person who fails to submit written notice of the intent to return to a position of employment within the appropriate period specified in this Subsection shall not automatically forfeit such person's entitlement to the rights and benefits referred to in Subsection A but shall be subject to the conduct rules, established policy, and general practices of the employer pertaining to explanations and discipline with respect to absence from scheduled work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(4) Nothing in this Subsection E shall restrict an employer's right to condition reemployment on its policies and procedures applicable to employees returning from leave, provided such policies and procedures are not in conflict with this and the other provisions of the Military Service Relief Act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">F.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(3)(a) Except as provided in Subparagraph (b), the failure of a person to provide documentation that satisfies regulations prescribed pursuant to Paragraph (2) shall not be a basis for denying reemployment in accordance with the provisions of this Part if the failure occurs because such documentation does not exist or is not readily available at the time of the request of the employer.&#160;&#160;If, after such reemployment, documentation becomes available that establishes that such person does not meet one or more of the requirements referred to in Subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) of Paragraph (1), the employer of such person may terminate the employment of the person and the provision of any rights or benefits afforded the person under this Part.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(b) An employer who reemploys a person absent from a position of employment for more than ninety days may require that the person provide the employer with the documentation referred to in Subparagraph (a) before beginning to treat the person as not having incurred a break in service for pension purposes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(4) An employer may not delay or attempt to defeat a reemployment obligation by demanding documentation that does not then exist or is not then readily available.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">G.

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">H. In any determination of a person's entitlement to protection under this Part, the timing, frequency, and duration of the person's training or service, or the nature of such training or service (including voluntary service) in the uniformed services, shall not be a basis for denying protection of this Part if the service does not exceed the limitations set forth in Subsection C and the notice requirements established in Paragraph A(1) and the notification requirements established in Subsection E are met.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I.
