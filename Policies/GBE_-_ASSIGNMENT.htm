<p class="Title">ASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>POSITION ASSIGNMENTS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board delegates to the Superintendent or his/her designee the assignment of all teachers, administrators, supervisory personnel, and other employees of the School Board to their respective positions and/or schools.&#160;&#160;The principal shall have the authority to determine the placement of all teachers or other personnel at the school in which the principal is employed, subject to the approval of the Superintendent. &#160;Personnel shall be assigned on the basis of performance, effectiveness, and qualifications applicable to each position.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In order to avoid conflicts of interest, or the appearance of same, it is the desire of the School Board that employees not be assigned to a position that would require that employee to be directly supervised by an immediate family member.&#160;&#160;The above provision, however, does not apply, in accordance with statutory provisions, to an immediate family member of an athletic director of a school, which may employ an immediate family member as a coach where he/she is athletic director. &#160;<b><i>Immediate family members</i></b> include the person’s children, the spouses of the person’s children, the person’s brothers and their spouses, the person’s sisters and their spouses, parents, spouse, and the parents of the person’s spouse.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For purposes of this policy, principals and assistant principals shall be considered to directly supervise all programs operated at their school; therefore no immediate family member of any principal or assistant principal shall be employed to work in any program operated at his/her school.&#160;&#160;Also, any department head shall be considered to directly supervise all operations in the department.&#160;&#160;However, in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a id="id1" href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/421119.htm');return false;" name="id1">42:1119</a>, should, in the normal course of promotional advancement, a person be appointed as the principal or assistant principal of a school in which his or her spouse is presently employed, the spouse may be allowed to remain at the school if he or she has been employed at the school for at least one (1) year prior to the appointment.&#160;&#160;This provision also pertains to supervisory staff as it relates to his/her spouse working in the department under his/her direct supervision.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board and administrative staff shall provide comparability of services by ensuring equivalence among schools in teachers, administrators, and auxiliary personnel.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>CLASS ASSIGNMENT</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The principal shall be responsible for assigning teachers to classes within his/her respective school.&#160;&#160;Except in extenuating circumstances, the principal shall notify teachers of their anticipated assignment for the school year prior to the opening of school. Teachers who wish to request reassignment for the subsequent school year may do so provided such request is submitted prior to the close of the school year.&#160;&#160;Principals shall give every reasonable consideration to teacher requests for assignment to a particular grade level and/or subject area for which a teacher is certified and qualified.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A teacher shall be notified by the principal of any change in assignment as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
