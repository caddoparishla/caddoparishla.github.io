<p class="Title">USE OF SCHOOL FACILITIES</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board recognizes the functions of school buildings and grounds shall be to accommodate approved school programs for students and to assist in meeting the educational, cultural, civic, social and recreational need of communities. &#160;Use of school buildings by the community shall be considered a secondary function so as not to interfere with regular school-day programs of the students.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>School Board property</i> shall include any elementary or secondary school grounds or buildings, any portable buildings, field houses, stadiums, equipment storage areas, vacant land, or any property owned, operated or leased by the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

The school principal or building level administrator shall designate a custodian to be scheduled to be on the premises from the beginning through clean-up time. &#160;This custodian shall be responsible for disarming/arming of any security system and the locking of exterior doors. &#160;The custodian shall assist with cleaning. &#160;However, as stated in the agreement, the group using the building shall be responsible for assuring that everything is clean and in order for classes.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of any School Board-owned or operated facility shall be prohibited during the school day for the purpose of political activities, campaigning or debates. &#160;Use of facilities shall not be permitted for activities prohibited by state law and/or School Board policies or considered in any way contrary to the best interests of the school system.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All persons attending the function or use of the school facility requested shall also be required to obey all rules and regulations of the School Board relating to school facilities, and the person, group, or organization shall be responsible for the conduct of all such persons.<br />

<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person shall be excluded from any meeting, program, or use because of that person’s race, color, creed, national origin, sex, religious or political preference.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The falsification of any information required or the failure to comply with all policies, regulations, and/or procedures shall result in the group or organization being prohibited from using any school facility in the future.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The School Board reserves the right, through the Superintendent, principal, or other designated person to cancel the use of any School Board-owned or operated facility at any time when deemed in the best interest of the school system.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the services of law enforcement, security personnel, and/or fire personnel are required, the person, group or organization shall be responsible for making the necessary arrangements for such services and shall fully apprise the principal or building level administrator prior to usage.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person, group, or organization granted approval to use facilities shall be permitted to move equipment into a facility during the school day.&#160;&#160;Programs or activities shall not begin before the end of the school day.&#160;&#160;All equipment, props or related materials shall be removed from School Board property prior to the beginning of the next school day.&#160;&#160;Equipment used on School Board property not involving a specific school site shall be removed as soon as possible, but no later than twenty-four (24) hours from termination of lease.<br />
<br />
School Board facilities and/or property shall be vacated not later than 11:00 pm.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>No hoofed animals shall be permitted on the athletic fields and/or any other area specified by the principal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>FEES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Rental fees charged for use of School Board facilities shall be in accordance with the schedule of fees approved by the School Board.&#160;&#160;It should be noted that the School Board cannot waive any fees or absorb any cost for use of its facilities by groups or organizations not considered part of the school, as this would be a donation of public funds which is prohibited by the state constitution.&#160;&#160;All fees, once calculated, shall be paid directly to the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SPECIAL PROVISIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Voting Precincts</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Use of school buildings for voting or polling places shall be authorized by the School Board on the condition that election officials in charge on Election Day shall permit no loitering on the school premises. &#160;The principal or building level administrator shall determine where voting shall be held on school campuses in accordance with state statutes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Arrangements for opening and closing the facilities shall be made with the principal of the school involved.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Civil Defense</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Civil Defense director is authorized to use any and all necessary school facilities for emergency shelters or accommodations to help provide services to the public in the event of any declared emergency, in coordination with the Superintendent and/or his/her designee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Film Industry</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Due to the various requests by film companies to utilize school facilities and vehicles for filming and the deadlines uniquely associated with the film industry, the School Board authorizes the Superintendent to enter into agreements with film companies for the use of facilities and vehicles for filming family movies or pictures intended to be rated no higher than PG13, when such use, in the Superintendent’s opinion, does not substantially interfere with the use of the facility and/or vehicle(s) for educational purposes.&#160;&#160;All agreements shall be reviewed and approved by the Caddo Parish School Board general counsel prior to execution.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Long Term Use</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Long term use of school facilities (a use greater than that required for a single event or a use exceeding one (1) week) by any outside person, organization or group for any activity not involving tutoring or enrichment activities for Caddo Parish students shall be initially approved by the School Board and shall not exceed a three (3) month lease term. &#160;In deciding whether to approve the long term use of a facility as described in this paragraph, the School Board shall determine that the proposed use does not interfere with the use of the facility for educationally intended purposes.&#160;&#160;Thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the initial term, or any additional term, the lessee shall notify the Superintendent or his/her designee of its intent to renew with preference over others who apply for the use of the facility.&#160;&#160;If the lessee fails to timely notify the Superintendent or his/her designee of its intent to renew its contract for use of the facility, the School Board may lease the facility to any other person or entity, or decide to use the facility for other purposes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Nothing in this policy shall obligate the Caddo Parish School Board to provide a facility for the lessee’s use if the facility under contract becomes unavailable due to mechanical failure, fire, flood, or any other condition making the facility unfit for use.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PURPOSES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Gymnasiums and Auditoriums</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>School gymnasiums may be used for social activities and dances for the student body of the school, provided that such entertainment is adequately chaperoned by parents of participating students and teachers; and that participation in such functions is limited to the student body of the local school.&#160;&#160;Students from other schools in the parish may attend when specifically invited, and when such invitations are approved by the principal of the local school.&#160;&#160;When schools choose to sponsor a prom, members of the junior and senior classes may invite their “dates” even though such guests are not members of the junior or the senior class.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The school shall have precedence in the use of its auditorium.&#160;&#160;School auditoriums and gymnasiums cannot be used by a non-school related individual or agency for the sole purpose of making a profit for themselves or their organization.&#160;&#160;Special interest groups whose purpose is to incite tension among local people and to advocate disobedience of local laws shall be denied the use of school buildings.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Use of auditoriums for political campaigns or rallies shall be prohibited.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Cafeterias/Lunchroom Facilities</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The same general policies governing the use of gymnasiums and auditoriums apply to the use of school cafeterias, with the exception that in the case of preparation of food, use of the kitchen equipment must be supervised by the lunchroom manager or cafeteria worker regularly employed by the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The facilities of the lunchroom may be used by organized community groups of non-personal benefit upon request to the Superintendent, provided the use does not interfere with the operation of the school lunch program.&#160;&#160;The group using the facilities shall be responsible for the loss of equipment and utensils.&#160;&#160;A lunchroom worker must be present.&#160;&#160;Facilities must be left clean and in order.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>USE OF SCHOOL GROUNDS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The public shall be allowed to use school grounds (excluding buildings) for recreational or sport purposes only during daylight hours and only during the time when classes or other school or school-sponsored or approved activities are not being held. &#160;No motor vehicles of any type, firearms or explosives or other dangerous weapons or alcoholic beverages shall be allowed on any school grounds.&#160;&#160;All activities of a non-recreational or non-sports nature, such as political rallies, gatherings, or meetings shall be prohibited.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>No supervisory personnel shall be provided during this time, and any person who uses the school grounds for the limited purposes set forth herein does so at his/her own risk. &#160;The School Board shall assume no liability for any accident, injury, or loss suffered by any person using the school grounds under the permission herein granted.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The person, group, or organization using school grounds shall be required to provide the required certificate of insurance prior to the use of school grounds.</p>
