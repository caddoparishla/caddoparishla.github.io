However, the school district shall not exercise such authority to sell, exchange, or lease any property or building unless it first offers such property or building without cost to the local public school board to which the property belonged prior to its being under the control of the school district and such local public school board refuses at a public meeting to accept the return of the property or building. Property sold, leased, or exchanged under the authority of this Item shall be sold at a price or leased or exchanged based on a value that is determined by averaging the market value appraisals of three appraisers, one selected by the administering agency of the Recovery School District, one selected by the governing authority of the independent secondary school, and a third appraiser selected by the two appraisers selected by the school district and the independent secondary school. The costs of determining the value shall be borne by the independent secondary school. Property sold or exchanged under the authority of this Item shall remain the property of the governing authority to which it was sold or exchanged by the school district regardless of the return of any school under the jurisdiction of the school district to the city, parish, or other local public school system from which it was originally transferred. However, any property sold or exchanged by the school district as authorized in this Item shall, if ever offered for sale or exchange by the governing authority of the independent school, first be offered to the city, parish, or other local public school board to which the property belonged prior to its being under the control of the Recovery School District. The authority granted in this Item may be exercised without compliance with any bidding requirements otherwise required by law. Any proceeds resulting from a lease or sale as provided in this Item shall be directed to the city, parish, or other local public school board to which the property belonged, regardless of it being under the control of the Recovery School District.&#160;</font></span></p>
