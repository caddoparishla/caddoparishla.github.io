<p class="PdfParaStyle04">17:2357 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rights and duties of procurement organizations;&#160;&#160;others</p>
<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
<p>A. When a hospital refers a person at or near death to a procurement organization, the procurement organization shall make a reasonable search of the records of the office of motor vehicles and any known donor registry to ascertain whether the person has made an anatomical gift.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>B. A procurement organization shall be allowed reasonable access to information in the records of the office of motor vehicles to ascertain whether a person at or near death is a donor.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>C. When a hospital refers a person at or near death to a procurement organization, the procurement organization may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to ensure the medical suitability of a part that is or may be the subject of an anatomical gift for transplantation, therapy, research, or education.&#160;&#160;During the examination period, measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the part may not be withdrawn unless the hospital or procurement organization knows that the person expressed a contrary intent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>D. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, at any time after the death of a donor, the person to which a part passes in accordance with R.S. 17:2353 may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>E. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, an examination in accordance with this Section may include an examination of all medical and dental records of the donor or prospective donor.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>F. Upon the death of a minor who was a donor or had signed a refusal, unless a procurement organization knows he was emancipated, it shall conduct a reasonable search for his parents and provide them with an opportunity to revoke or amend the anatomical gift or the refusal.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>G. Upon referral by a hospital in accordance with Subsection A of this Section, a procurement organization shall make a reasonable search for any person listed in R.S. 17:2354.2 having priority to make an anatomical gift on behalf of a person.&#160;&#160;If a procurement organization receives information that an anatomical gift was made, amended, or revoked, it shall promptly advise the person of all relevant information.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>H. Subject to R.S. 17:2353, the rights of the person to which a part passes in accordance with this Part are superior to the rights of all others with respect to the part.&#160;&#160;The person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in whole or in part.&#160;&#160;Subject to the terms of the document of gift and this Part, a person that accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may allow embalming, burial, cremation, and use of remains in a funeral service.&#160;&#160;If the gift is a part, the person to which the part passes shall cause it to be removed without unnecessary mutilation prior to embalming, burial, or cremation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I. Neither the physician who attends the decedent at death nor the physician who determines the time of the death may participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part from the decedent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>J. A qualified physician or technician may remove a donated part from the body of a donor.</p>
