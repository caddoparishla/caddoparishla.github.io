<p class="Title">POLITICAL ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is strongly felt by the Caddo Parish School Board that teachers should stress the importance of citizenship responsibilities and the political rights of citizenship to each student. For administrators, teachers and staff to be able to place strong emphasis on these areas, the School Board believes they should have the right to enjoy these privileges, free from any pressures and/or concerns. &#160;It is felt that all employees should be free to support candidates of their choice, exercising their own good judgment.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>All personnel shall be notified that they must not be part of any activity relating to the campaign or election of any candidate for political office during office hours or while on duty, nor use any School Board facility for any such activity. &#160;This includes, but is not limited to, making or soliciting contributions to campaign funds, or promoting any candidate by distribution of cards, pictures,handbills, clothing and pins, making telephone contacts, or in any other way. &#160;This requirement applies in every school of the system,department of the system and on school buses.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any materials or equipment (for example, mailing lists, copy machines,etc.) owned or held by the School Board, or staff, shall not be made available to any group or individual without the School Board’s approval.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Political Advertising on School Board Property:<br />
<br />
The Louisiana Constitution (<a href="http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=206346" target="_blank">Art. XI Sec 4</a>) and Louisiana Statutes (La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a id="id1" href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/181470.htm');return false;" name="id1">18:1470</a>) prohibit the use of School Board property for erection,display, or posting of any political campaign signs or the appropriation of any public funds or things of value to urge any voter to support or oppose any candidate or electoral proposition.<br />
<br />
Accordingly no political campaign signs shall be erected or displayed on School Board property or School Board vehicles at any place or time, regardless of the fact that the candidate, or any person urging adoption of an electoral proposition may offer to pay for advertising space school board property even when space is offered for non- political advertisement.<br />
<br />
The prohibition contained in the policy shall not apply to:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top: .35pt;">&#160;</p>
<div style="list-style: upper-alpha; margin-left: 2em">
<ol start="1" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p>Signs urging students to vote for students in school elections, such as student council, class officers, and the like.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bumper stickers or other campaign signs affixed to the vehicles of private persons, &#160;including &#160;School Board &#160;employees, &#160;temporarily &#160;parked &#160;on &#160;School Board &#160;property, while said persons are in the normal course of their duties or tending to their business at a school or School Board offices or attending a school function or athletic event, provided that the parking of such vehicles shall be permitted for only the period of time reasonably required for the owner or driver's accomplishment of their duties or attendance at the school or school board office, or athletic or school function.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Violation of any aspect of this policy could subject the employee to suspension and/or dismissal.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board states that the provisions of this policy shall apply during business hours or while an employee is on official School Board business, and is not intended to interfere with personal time or affairs away from offices or school facilities in any way.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Additionally, as provided by Article XI, Section 4, of the Louisiana Constitution, school board employees or administrative personnel are permitted to supply in the course of their employment, purely factual information concerning School Board sponsored bond, tax or like propositions appearing on a ballot,provided that the communications shall not advocate either support of or opposition to the ballot proposition.</p>
