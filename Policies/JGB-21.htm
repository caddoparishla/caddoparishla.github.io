<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>NUTRITION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board is committed to serving healthy meals to children, with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free and low-fat milk; that are moderate in sodium, low in saturated fat, and have zero grams <i>trans-</i>fat per serving (nutrition label or manufacturer’s specification); and to meeting the nutrition needs of school children within their calorie requirements.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>To promote hydration, free, safe, unflavored drinking water shall be available to all students throughout the school day and throughout every school campus. &#160;The School Board shall make drinking water available where school meals are served during mealtimes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Competitive Foods and Beverages</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board is committed to ensuring that all foods and beverages available to students on the school campus during the school day support healthy eating. &#160;The foods and beverages sold and served outside of the school meal programs (e.g., “competitive” foods and beverages) shall meet the nutrition standards as outlined in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7dafecd5393e9f33cbc420ebeb9068ad&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se7.4.210_111&amp;rgn=div8">7 CFR 210.11</a>. &#160;These standards aim to improve student health and well-being, increase consumption of healthful foods during the school day and create an environment that reinforces the development of healthy eating habits.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>To support healthy food choices and improve student health and well-being, all foods and beverages outside the reimbursable school meal programs that are sold to students on the school campus during the school day shall meet or exceed the USDA nutrition standards.&#160;&#160;These standards shall apply in all locations and through all services where foods and beverages are sold, which may include, but are not limited to, à la carte options in cafeterias, vending machines, school stores and snack or food carts.</p>

</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Nutrition Promotion</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Nutrition Education</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall teach, model, encourage and support healthy eating by all students.&#160;&#160;Schools shall provide nutrition education and engage in nutrition promotion that:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">

</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Physical Education</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall provide students with physical education, using an age-appropriate, sequential physical education curriculum consistent with national and state standards for physical education.&#160;&#160;The physical education curriculum shall promote the benefits of a physically active lifestyle and will help students develop skills to engage in lifelong healthy habits.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All School Board elementary (K-8) students shall receive physical education for at least 30 minutes per day throughout the school year.&#160;&#160;High school students are required to have a minimum of 1.5 Carnegie units in physical education to graduate.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board physical education program shall promote student physical fitness through individualized fitness and activity assessments and shall use criterion-based reporting for each student.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Physical Activity</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students in grades K-8 are required by state law to receive at least thirty (30) minutes of physical activity per day.&#160;&#160;High school students shall be encouraged to incorporate physical activity into their day.&#160;&#160;A substantial percentage of students’ physical activity can be provided through a comprehensive school physical activity program.&#160;&#160;Such programs reflect strong coordination and synergy across all of the components: quality physical education as the foundation; physical activity before, during and after school; staff involvement and family and community engagement.&#160;&#160;Schools shall ensure that varied physical activity opportunities are in addition to, and not as a substitute for, physical education.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>To the extent practicable, the School Board shall ensure that its grounds and facilities are safe and that equipment is available to students to be active.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Classroom Physical Activity Breaks (Elementary and Secondary)</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board recognizes that students are more attentive and ready to learn if provided with periodic breaks when they can be physically active or stretch.&#160;&#160;Thus, students shall be offered periodic opportunities to be active or to stretch throughout the day on all or most days during a typical school week.&#160;&#160;Teachers shall be encouraged to provide short (3-5-minute) physical activity breaks to students during and between classroom time at least three (3) days per week.&#160;&#160;Such physical activity breaks shall complement, not substitute, for physical education class, recess, and class transition periods.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall provide resources and links to resources, tools, and technology with ideas for classroom physical activity breaks.&#160;&#160;Resources and ideas are also available through USDA and other organizations which promote health and wellness.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Active Academics</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Teachers shall be encouraged to incorporate movement and kinesthetic learning approaches into “core” subject instruction when possible (e.g., science, math, language arts, social studies and others) and do their part to limit sedentary behavior during the school day.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall support classroom teachers incorporating physical activity and employing kinesthetic learning approaches into core subjects by providing annual professional development opportunities and resources, including information on leading activities, activity options, as well as making available background material on the connections between learning and movement.&#160;&#160;Teachers shall serve as role models by being physically active alongside the students whenever feasible.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE STUDENT WELLNESS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall integrate wellness activities across the entire school setting, not just in the cafeteria, other food and beverage venues and physical activity facilities.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall coordinate and integrate other initiatives related to physical activity, physical education, nutrition and other wellness components so all efforts are complementary, not duplicative, and work towards the same set of goals and objectives promoting student well-being, optimal development and strong educational outcomes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Public schools in Caddo Parish shall be encouraged to coordinate content across curricular areas that promote student health, such as teaching nutrition concepts in mathematics, with consultation provided by either the school or the School Board’s curriculum experts.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All efforts related to obtaining federal, state or other organizational recognition for efforts, or grants/funding opportunities for healthy school environments shall be coordinated with and complementary of the <i>School Wellness</i> policy, including but not limited to ensuring the involvement of the <i>School Health Advisory Council</i>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All school-sponsored events shall adhere to the <i>School Wellness</i> policy guidelines.&#160;&#160;All school-sponsored wellness events shall include physical activity and healthy eating opportunities when appropriate.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
