<p class="Title">SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER COMPENSATION AND EXPENSES</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board shall provide a monthly expense allowance for its members in accordance with state law and at a rate set by the School Board.&#160;&#160;Each member of the School Board shall receive $800.00 per month, and the President shall receive $900.00 per month, which shall include a $50.00 per diem for attending one Executive Committee meeting per month on a day other than when a School Board meeting or School Board Committee meeting is held and an additional $50.00 per diem per month for discharging his/her duties as President.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>School Board members shall also be authorized to receive reimbursement for mileage going to and from meetings as well as reimbursement for actual travel and related expenses outside the jurisdictional boundaries of the School Board while on official School Board business, all in accordance with School Board policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A School Board member who does not attend regular or special meetings of the School Board, including committee meetings, may be required to forfeit up to one-third of their expense allowance for each nonattendance without reasonable excuse, the amount of said forfeiture to be determined by the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any action decreasing the compensation for School Board members shall not take effect during the term for which they were elected.&#160;&#160;Any action increasing the compensation for School Board members shall require a <b><i>two-thirds</i></b> <span style="font-weight: bold;">(⅔)</span> <b><i>vote of the total membership</i></b>.&#160;&#160;Before any action is taken, however, the School Board shall advertise in the official journal of the School Board the time and place of a meeting to consider the expense allowance.&#160;&#160;The advertisement shall appear on at least two (2) separate days during the fifteen (15) days immediately preceding such meeting.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Members of the Executive Committee shall receive an additional $50.00 per diem per month for attendance at one Executive Committee meeting during the month on a day other than when a School Board meeting is held.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>TRAVEL EXPENSES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board recognizes the value of attendance at the Louisiana and National School Boards Conventions.&#160;&#160;School Board members may attend up to one (1) out of state conference during the fiscal year.&#160;&#160;The administrative staff may be represented by the Superintendent or a person designated by him/her at such conventions.&#160;&#160;The School Board President shall be authorized to approve additional attendees within the approved School Board budget.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The President of the School Board shall authorize in writing individual School Board members to attend hearings, meetings, seminars or workshops that in the President’s opinion are beneficial to the Caddo Parish School Board.&#160;&#160;School Board members shall submit their requests to the President prior to attending the conference.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Policies and administrative regulations governing reimbursement for expense reimbursements for employees shall also apply to School Board members.&#160;&#160;Total trip expense and reimbursement by personal car should not exceed the amount that total expense would have been if traveling by plane.&#160;&#160;However, the President of the School Board may make exceptions concerning travel arrangements.&#160;&#160;The President shall sign the authorization for reimbursement of travel expenses for School Board members.</p>
