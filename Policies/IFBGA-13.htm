<p><u>INTERNET SAFETY</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Internet is a vast, global computer network that provides access to major universities, governmental agencies, other school systems, and commercial providers of data banks.&#160;&#160;The Caddo Parish School Board shall establish appropriate guidelines for exploring and using Internet resources within the school district to enhance learning and teaching activities.&#160;&#160;Acceptable use of these resources shall be consistent with the philosophy, goals and objectives of the Caddo Parish School Board.&#160;&#160;In addition, age and grade appropriate classroom instruction shall be provided regarding Internet and cell phone safety.&#160;&#160;Such instruction shall include appropriate online behavior, interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms, and cyberbullying awareness and response, as well as areas of concern as authorized in state and federal law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In its continued efforts to comply with the <i>Children's Internet Protection Act</i>, the School District shall adopt and enforce a policy of Internet safety that incorporates the use of computer-related technology or the use of Internet service provider technology designed to block or filter Internet access for minors and adults to certain visual depictions, including without limitation those that are obscene, child pornographic, or harmful to minors, including without limitation sites that are excessively, violent, pervasively vulgar, or sexually harassing.&#160;&#160;Sites which contain information on the manufacturing of bombs or other incendiary devices shall also be prohibited.&#160;&#160;Only authorized persons may disable for an adult user the blocking or filtering mechanism in order to enable Internet access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes, which shall include online services for legitimate scientific or educational purposes approved by the School Board, or access to online services of a newspaper with a daily circulation of at least 1,000.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prohibit unauthorized access, including what is now known as "hacking" and other unlawful on-line activities by minors online;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prohibit unauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of personal information regarding minors; and<br />
