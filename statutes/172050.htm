<p class="PdfParaStyle04" style="text-indent: -72px; margin-left: 72px;">17:2050 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Community colleges; recognition; authority to award associate degrees; certificates</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. (1) The legislature hereby recognizes that, based upon legislative request and authority granted by House Concurrent Resolution No. 52 of the Regular Session of 1966, the State Board of Education established a pilot program to utilize existing facilities in at least two high schools within the state for the purpose of offering junior college level accredited courses, and that the State Board of Education, acting under its authority, in 1967 and 1968 approved establishment of thirteenth and fourteenth year pilot programs both in St. Bernard and Bossier Parishes and by subsequent action instructed the state colleges and universities under the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education to accept the credits earned by students participating in these pilot programs. The St. Bernard Parish School Board and the Bossier Parish School Board, by resolution, designated the thirteenth and fourteenth grade program in their parishes as the St. Bernard Parish Community College and the Bossier Parish Community College, respectively.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(2) The legislature further recognizes that the students who have completed a two-year course of instruction at St. Bernard Parish Community College and Bossier Parish Community College have demonstrated the value of their courses of instruction by their performance in four-year institutions of higher learning and in the world of business, and that considerable public funds have been expended to assure adequate facilities and faculty at these two schools to afford quality education beyond the high school level for students within the community in which they live.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. Any public school or public educational institution which on the effective date of this Section offers courses of study or curricula above the level required for graduation from a public secondary school in this state, some or all of which are accepted for credit by any public or private college or university in Louisiana is a post-secondary institution, and any such institution may grant associate degrees and certificates upon the completion of prescribed, unified courses of study as prescribed by the institution and approved by the appropriate state management boards and the Board of Regents, provided that the approval of the Board of Regents shall be given in accordance with the provisions of Subparagraph D(2) of Section 5 of Article VIII of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974. Such degrees and certificates shall require the specific approval of the Board of Regents.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;C. (1) The legislature further recognizes the establishment, beginning July 1, 1992, of the Elaine P. Nunez Community College as a two-year institution of higher education under the management of the Board of Trustees of State Colleges and Universities. After that date the approval of degrees and programs shall be consistent with that for all other similar institutions of higher education, except as necessary for a period of transition and as provided otherwise by R.S.17:1821 and 1822.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(2) Effective July 1, 1999, the Elaine P. Nunez Community College shall be under the management of the Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;D. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary and effective July 1, 1997, the legislature recognizes Bossier Parish Community College as a two-year institution of higher education under the management of the Board of Trustees for State Colleges and Universities. Subsequent to this date, the approval of degrees and programs shall be consistent with that for all other similar institutions of higher education except as provided otherwise by R.S. 17:1825.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(2) Effective July 1, 1999, the Bossier Parish Community College shall be under the management of the Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges.</p>
