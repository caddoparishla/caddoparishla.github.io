<p style="margin-left: 8px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">For example, if an employee has already taken six (6) weeks of FMLA leave, that employee would then be eligible for another six (6) weeks of emergency FMLA leave under this policy.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Leave shall be unpaid for the first ten (10) days of Emergency FMLA Leave; however, employees may use any accrued paid vacation, sick or personal leave during this time. The employee may also elect to use the paid leave provided under the <i>Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act</i> (EPSLA) as provided in Paragraph II – EMERGENCY PAID SICK LEAVE DUE TO COVID-19 OUTBREAK. &#160;After the first ten (10) days, leave shall be paid at two-thirds&#160;(<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">⅔</font></span>) of an employee’s regular rate of pay for the number of hours the employee would otherwise be scheduled to work. &#160;Pay shall not exceed $200 per day, and $10,000 in total, or $12,000 in total if using emergency paid sick leave for the first two (2) weeks. &#160;Any unused portion of this pay shall not carry over to the next year.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8px;">For employees with varying hours, one of two methods for computing the number of hours paid shall be used:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8px; text-decoration: underline;">Employee Status and Benefits During Emergency FMLA Leave due to COVID-19</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">While an employee is on leave, the School Board shall continue the employee's health benefits during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions as if the employee had continued to work. &#160;While on paid leave, the School Board shall continue to make payroll deductions to collect the employee's share of the premium. During any unpaid portions of leave, the employee shall continue to make this payment per instructions from the School Board staff.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the employee contributes to a life insurance or disability plan, the School Board shall continue making payroll deductions while the employee is on paid leave. &#160;During any portion of unpaid leave, the employee may request continuation of such benefits and pay his or her portion of the premiums. &#160;If the employee does not continue these payments, the School Board may discontinue coverage during the leave.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8px; text-decoration: underline;">Procedure for Requesting Emergency FMLA Leave</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">All employees requesting Emergency FMLA leave shall provide written notice, where possible, of the need for leave to the School Board as soon as practicable. &#160;Verbal notice shall otherwise be accepted until written notice can be provided.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The notice the employee provides should include a brief statement as to the reason for leave, and if possible, the expected duration.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">On a basis that does not discriminate against employees on Emergency FMLA leave, the School Board may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee's status and intent to return to work.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; text-decoration: underline;">Employee Status After taking Emergency FMLA Leave</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Generally, an employee who takes Emergency FMLA leave shall be able to return to the same position or a position with equivalent status, pay, benefits and other employment terms. &#160;The School Board may choose to exempt certain key employees from this requirement and not return them to the same or similar position when doing so will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to business operations. &#160;Key employees shall be given written notice at the time Emergency FMLA leave is requested of his or her status as a key employee.</p>
