<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(2) Each school board which employs the teacher who meets the criteria set forth in Paragraph (C)(1) and Subparagraph (C)(1)(b) of this Section and enters into a contract with the school board to participate in the program, upon execution of a program contract by the administering agency, shall receive a payment of six thousand dollars to be paid by the school board to such teacher for the first year of teaching as provided in this Section.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For each of the three consecutive years immediately following the first year of teaching, if the teacher is continued in the program by the school board based upon its evaluation of the teacher's performance and the school is continued in the program as determined by the department, the school board which employs the teacher shall receive six thousand dollars for each year of participation in the program up to the limitation prescribed in Paragraph (3) of this Subsection.</p>
