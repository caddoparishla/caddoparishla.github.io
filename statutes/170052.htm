Thereafter, the election of additional school board members shall be in accordance with the provisions herein made applicable to the election of school board members in the election year 1986.</p>

However, at the next regular election for members of the school board following a reapportionment, an elector may qualify as a candidate from any district created in whole or in part from a district existing prior to reapportionment if he was domiciled in the prior district for at least one year immediately preceding his qualification and was a resident of the state for the two years preceding his qualification.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(2) The seat of any member who changes his domicile from the district he represents or, if elected after reapportionment, whose domicile is not within the district he represents at the time he is sworn into office shall be vacated thereby, any declaration of retention of domicile to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(3) For purposes of this Section, "domicile" means a person's principal or habitual place of residence.</p>
