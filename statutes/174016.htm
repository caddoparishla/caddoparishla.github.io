The department shall allocate annually from funds appropriated or otherwise available for the program an amount per pupil to each participating school equal to the amount allocated per pupil as provided in the minimum foundation program formula, inclusive of the calculations of both the local and state per pupil allocations, to the local school system in which the scholarship recipient resides, considering all student characteristics. For a participating school that charges tuition, if the maximum amount of tuition plus incidental or supplementary fees that are charged to non-scholarship students enrolled in such school and any costs incurred in administering the tests required pursuant to <span style="color: #000000; text-underline: none; text-decoration: none;"><font color="black">R.S. 17:4023</font></span> is less than the amount allocated per pupil to the local school system in which the student resides, then the amount allocated per pupil to the school shall be equal to the sum of such maximum tuition amount, such incidental or supplementary fees charged to non-scholarship students, and such testing costs.</font></span></p>

This amount shall be in addition to the participating nonpublic schoolâ€™s maximum scholarship payment as described in Subsection A of this Section but the total of the payment and the special education tuition shall not exceed the amount that would be allocated as provided in Subsection A of this Section for that student to the local school system if the student otherwise would be attending public school.</font></span></p>
