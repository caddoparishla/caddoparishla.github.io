<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
<p class="PlainText">(a) Increase tuition and fee amounts by up to ten percent annually, without legislative approval, until the institution reaches the average tuition and fee amounts of its peer institutions.&#160;&#160;The incremental tuition and fee amount increase shall be weighted in such a manner that the median household income in Southern Regional Education Board states in which respective peer institutions are located is compared with the median household income in Louisiana, and any differences between the average of the states be factored into the allowable tuition and fee amount increase.</p>
<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
