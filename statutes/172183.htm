The bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness shall be signed by the chairman or the vice chairman and attested by the secretary of the board of supervisors, and coupon bonds shall have attached thereto interest coupons bearing the facsimile signatures of the officers who sign the bonds. They shall have affixed thereto the seal of the board of supervisors.

The refunding bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness shall be authorized in all respects as original bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness are herein required to be authorized, and the board of supervisors, in authorizing the refunding bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness, shall provide for the security of the bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness, the sources from which they are to be paid, and the rights of the holders thereof in all respects, as herein provided for other bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness issued under the authority of this SubPart. The board of supervisors may also provide that the refunding bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness shall have the same priority of lien on the revenues pledged for their payment as was enjoyed by the bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness refunded. No bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness may be refunded hereunder unless they either mature or are callable for redemption under their terms within ten years from the date of issuance of the refunding bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness, or unless the <span class="PdfCharStyle1">holders thereof voluntarily surrender them in exchange for payment.</span></p>
