<p class="Title">BRING YOUR OWN DEVICE (BYOD) RESPONSIBLE USE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board is committed to creating a 21st century learning environment to provide equitable access to technology that will aid students in becoming self-directed learners, collaborative team players, and information producers as well as information consumers.&#160;&#160;As part of this vision, the School Board shall allow students to access the School Board’s filtered wireless network using their own technology device (netbooks, laptops, smart phones, and tablets) for personal use at the following specified times during the school day:&#160;&#160;before/after school, and in the classroom when specifically permitted by the classroom teacher.&#160;&#160;Utilization of personal technology devices to enhance learning in the classroom shall be encouraged when deemed appropriate for all students in a given classroom, and at the discretion of the teacher.&#160;&#160;The classroom teacher shall specifically authorize utilization of personal devices, otherwise devices shall remain off and put away.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Many teachers and their students utilize Teacher Web, Edmodo, Google Applications and other online resources for personal productivity and academic purposes and allowing the use of personal technology devices facilitates timely accessibility for these users to their resources, enhancing the opportunity for productivity and success.&#160;&#160;Principals shall be required to have copies of lesson plans or instructional material that utilize these online resources.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>While users may operate their own devices to access the Internet, they must do so by placing their device in Airplane Mode and utilizing the School Board’s filtered wireless connection.&#160;&#160;Users of the School Board’s wireless network shall have filtered Internet access just as they would on a school district-owned device.&#160;&#160;The use of private (3G/4G) network access on school grounds shall be strictly prohibited.&#160;&#160;Users may not disable, override or circumvent school district technology filters and protection measures.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>AVAILABILITY OF ACCESS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students may bring their own technology devices (BYOD) to school campuses.&#160;&#160;Access to the School Board’s electronic communications system is a privilege, not a right.&#160;&#160;All users shall be required to acknowledge receipt and understanding of all administrative regulations governing use of the system and shall agree in writing to comply with such regulations and guidelines.&#160;&#160;When abused, privileges shall be taken away.&#160;&#160;When respected, they benefit the learning environment as a whole.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students and parents/guardians participating in BYOD shall adhere to the <i>Student Code of Conduct</i>, as well as all School Board policies, particularly policy <i><a href="IFBGA-13.htm">IFBGA, Computer Access and Use</a>.</i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the student and parent shall agree to the following conditions:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The student shall take full responsibility for his or her technology device.&#160;&#160;The school shall not be responsible for the security of student-owned technology.</font></span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The technology shall be in silent mode while on school campuses and while riding school buses.</font></span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The technology shall not be used to cheat on assignments or tests, or for non-instructional purposes.</font></span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The student shall access only files on the computer or internet sites which are relevant to the classroom curriculum.</font></span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The student shall comply with the teachers’ request to shut down the device or close the screen.</font></span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The student shall acknowledge that the school’s network filters shall be applied to one’s connection to the internet and shall not attempt to bypass them.</font></span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The student shall understand that bringing onto school premises or infecting the network with a Virus, Trojan, or program designed to damage, alter, destroy, or provide access to unauthorized data or information is a violation of policy and shall result in disciplinary action.</font></span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The student shall realize that processing or accessing information on school property related to “hacking”, altering, or bypassing network security policies is in violation of the policy and shall result in disciplinary actions.</font></span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The school district has the right to collect and examine any device that is suspected of causing problems or may be the source of an attack or virus infection.</font></span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The student shall realize that printing from personal technology devices shall not be possible at school.</font></span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">The student and parent shall sign and submit the acceptable use agreement for BYOD.</font></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Noncompliance with the applicable regulations may result in limitation, suspension, or termination of privileges, and other disciplinary action consistent with appropriate Caddo Parish School Board policies.&#160;&#160;Devices that are used in violation of School Board policy shall be relinquished to school administrators and held for up to three (3) days, only to be returned to the parent or guardians.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Violations may result in criminal prosecution as well as disciplinary action by the School Board.</p>
