<p class="PdfParaStyle04">41:897 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bossier Parish School Board; exchange of unused school land</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. Whenever the Bossier Parish School Board determines that a parcel of its property in Bossier Parish, including but not limited to sixteenth section land, is no longer needed for school purposes and that the best interest of the public school system would be served by the exchange of such land for other land of comparable value, the school board may exchange such land for other land in Bossier Parish in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. The Bossier Parish School Board shall hold a public hearing to receive public comment concerning the exchange of such lands. Prior to the public hearing, the school board shall obtain an appraisal from a certified appraiser of the lands being considered for exchange, and such appraisal shall be available for public inspection at the hearing.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;C. The school board shall provide notice of the public hearing and notice of its intent to consider the exchange of land as well as a brief description of both parcels of land by advertisement in the official journal of the parish in which the land is situated on at least three separate days at least thirty days prior to the date on which the hearing is to be held.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;D. After such hearing and after giving due consideration to any public comment, the school board may, at a regularly scheduled meeting, authorize the advertised exchange, provided that a majority of the elected membership of the school board determines that the exchange is for a valid purpose in the best interest of the school board and that the lands to be exchanged are of comparable value. The president of the school board shall thereafter proceed with the exchange of the lands in accordance with law and upon authorization of the school board.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;E. The powers and rights conferred by this Section shall be in addition to the powers and rights conferred by any other general or special law. This Section does and shall be construed to provide a complete and additional method for the exchange of unused school lands, including but not limited to sixteenth section lands, by the school board. No proceeding notice or approval shall be required for the exchange of unused school land by the school board, except as provided herein. The provisions of this Section shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of its purposes.</p>
