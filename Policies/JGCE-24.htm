<p><i>Caretaker</i> means any person legally obligated to provide or secure adequate care for a&#160;child, including a parent, tutor, guardian, legal custodian, foster home parent, an employee of a public or private day care center, an operator or employee of a registered family&#160;child&#160;day care home, or other person providing a residence for the&#160;child.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Child</i>, for purposes of this policy, means a person under eighteen (18) years of age, who prior to juvenile proceedings, has not been judicially emancipated or emancipated by marriage.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A <i>mandatory reporter</i> means any teaching or child care provider, which is any person who provides or assists in the teaching, training, and supervision of a&#160;child, including any public or private teacher, teacher's aide, instructional aide, school principal, school staff member, bus operator, coach, professor, technical or vocational instructor, technical or vocational school staff member, college or university administrator, college or university staff member, social worker, probation officer, foster home parent, group home or other&#160;child&#160;care institutional staff member, personnel of residential home facilities, a licensed or unlicensed day care provider, or any individual who provides these services to a&#160;child&#160;in a voluntary or professional capacity.&#160;&#160;In addition, any police officer or law enforcement officer who works as a school resource officer shall be considered a mandatory reporter.&#160;&#160;A school resource officer shall not receive information from another mandatory reporter or commence or oversee any investigation into the report.</p>

Neglect includes prenatal neglect. In accordance with statutory provisions, the inability of a parent or caretaker to provide for a&#160;child&#160;due to inadequate financial resources shall not, for that reason alone, be considered neglect. Whenever, in lieu of medical care, a&#160;child&#160;is being provided treatment in accordance with the tenets of a well-recognized religious method of healing which has a reasonable, proven record of success, the&#160;child&#160;shall not, for that reason alone, be considered to be neglected or maltreated.&#160;However, nothing herein shall prohibit the court from ordering medical services for the&#160;child when there is substantial risk of harm to the&#160;child's&#160;health or welfare.</p>
