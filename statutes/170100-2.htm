Pursuant thereto, parish school boards entering into such compacts are authorized to pool their resources, administrative, instructional or otherwise, and to allocate funds for the purposes thereof, provided the contribution of any board shall be proportioned according to the number of its students benefiting therefrom.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;C. In carrying out the purposes of the compact, participating boards may:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;1. Collect, correlate, analyze and interpret information and data concerning educational needs and resources of the multi-parish unit.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;2.
