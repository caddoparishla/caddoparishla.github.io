<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ADMISSION TO HIGH SCHOOL MAGNET PROGRAMS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In order to be admitted into a magnet program in Caddo Parish the parents/student must:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Meet all requirements for GPA, standardized test scores, and attendance for the magnet program as established by the Caddo Parish School Board,<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have parental/guardian consent and support,<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make application and have application approved by the principal of the magnet school, and<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute a magnet contract for at least one school year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student who moves into Caddo Parish from another school district and has been enrolled in a comparable magnet program in the school district from which the student moved may be considered for admission in a magnet program if all admission requirements are met and there is room available in the magnet program.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Retention In the Magnet Program</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In order to remain in a magnet program in Caddo Parish Schools, a student must maintain the proper cumulative GPA and conform to behavior standards for the magnet program. Unless there are unusual circumstances or infractions of the rules of the magnet program, students will be placed on probation or under advisement before they are removed from the magnet program. &#160;The magnet school will maintain documentation that the student and the parents/guardians were notified, in writing, of this probation/advisement period and the terms and conditions associated with it. &#160;It is strongly recommended that ninth grade students be placed on probation or under advisement for the next year rather than removed from the magnet program.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Removal from the Magnet Program</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Except in unusual circumstances, students will be removed from a magnet program only after they have been placed on probation or under advisement and the terms of the probation/advisement explained, in writing, to both the student and the parents/guardians.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The decision to remove a student from the magnet program is made by the magnet principal only after receiving input from assistant principals, counselors and teachers. &#160;Each of the student's teachers will prepare a <i>Student Evaluation Sheet</i>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that seniors in a magnet program be allowed to finish their last year in that magnet program. &#160;&#160;Every effort should be made to identify problem students and reassign them if necessary before their senior year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students returning to the neighborhood school shall do so with the approval of the neighborhood principal. &#160;If the student is under administrative probation for discipline, that student may be assigned to the <i>School away from School</i> if the administrative probation contract is violated during the school year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The appeal process for removal of a student from a magnet program is outlined in the following steps:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Parents/student may request a conference with the magnet school principal.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If still not satisfied with the decision, the parents/student may request a conference with the appropriate director in the central office. &#160;The director may uphold the decision of the magnet school principal or, if circumstances warrant, return the student to the magnet program under administrative probation.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the parents/student are not satisfied with the decision of the director, they may appeal the director's decision to the Superintendent. &#160;The decision of the Superintendent is final.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Return to a Neighborhood School</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Parents/students desiring to leave a magnet program may return to a neighborhood school or apply for admission to another magnet program at the end of a school year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Except in extenuating circumstances, no transfers between magnet schools or from a magnet school to a neighborhood school will be authorized after the school year begins.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If extenuating circumstances exist, the contract with the magnet school may be terminated during the school year with the agreement of both the magnet principal and the neighborhood principal. &#160;Documentation such as a physician's statement may be required. &#160;The parents/student may use the appeal process described above if they are not satisfied about the decision of the magnet/neighborhood principals.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>POLICY REVIEW</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board will review this policy with input from staff two years after its adoption, and every two years thereafter, to determine if revisions are needed.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
