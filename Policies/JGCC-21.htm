<p class="Title">COMMUNICABLE DISEASE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board recognizes the importance of protecting the health and welfare of the educational system from the spread of communicable diseases, including AIDS.&#160;&#160;A <i>communicable disease</i> shall be defined as a persistent or recurring infection which may be potentially transmitted to a susceptible person by contact with an infected individual.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When reliable evidence or information from a public health officer or physician confirms a student or employee of the School Board has a communicable disease or infection that is known to be spread by any form of casual contact and is considered a health threat to the school population, the Superintendent may exclude such person from school or employment for not more than five (5) days.&#160;&#160;Such student or staff member shall be excluded unless the public health officer approves school attendance or employment or the condition is no longer contagious.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When reliable evidence or information from a public health officer or physician confirms a student or staff member has a communicable disease or infection that is known not to be spread by casual contact, the decision as to whether or not the affected person will remain in school or the employment workplace shall be addressed on a case-by-case basis by a <i>Review Panel</i> to ensure due process.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the infected individual is a student and his/her physician and/or a physician of the School Board's choice indicates that the health of the student does not allow his/her continued attendance in the regular education program, education services shall be provided in the setting appropriate to the health status of the child.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students whose parent/guardian knowingly conceal their child's having a communicable disease shall, upon identification, be suspended from school on an excused absence status, with the opportunity to make-up assignments and graded activities, for a maximum of ten (10) school days, during which time the Superintendent shall determine the student's school attendance status.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0pt;">Irrespective of the disease presence, routine procedures shall be used and adequate sanitation facilities will be available for handling blood or body fluids within the school setting or school buses.&#160;&#160;School personnel will be trained in the proper procedures for handling blood and body fluids and these procedures shall be strictly adhered to by all school personnel (see policy <i><a href="GAMFB_-_GUIDELINES_FOR_HANDLING_BODY_FLUIDS_IN_SCHOOL.htm">GAMFB, Guidelines for Handling Body Fluids in Schools</a></i>).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>REVIEW PANEL</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Communicable diseases that are known not to be spread by casual contact shall be addressed on a case-by-case basis by a <i>Review Panel</i>.&#160;&#160;Membership of the <i>Review Pane</i>l, procedures for convening the <i>Review Panel</i>, and the process used to review the case shall be as outlined in <i style="font-size: 16px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Health and Safety</i>, Bulletin 135.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent shall provide a written decision to the affected party within three (3) operational days (i.e., a day when the School Board Central Office is open for business) after the Panel convenes.&#160;&#160;The written decision shall convey information brought out during the review process and include the rationale for the decision concerning school attendance by the student or employee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>APPEALS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Appeals may be made by the parent, guardian, or affected employee in writing to the Superintendent and subsequently to the School Board as outlined in <i style="font-size: 16px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Health and Safety</i><span style="font-size: 16px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline ! important ; float: none;">, Bulletin 135</span>.&#160;&#160;If the written decision of the Superintendent is contrary to the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><i>majority opinion of the Review Panel</i></span>, a <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><i>majority of the Review Panel</i></span> has the right to appeal the decision in the same manner as outlined in Bulletin 135.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>CONFIDENTIALITY</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All persons involved in procedures to assess school attendance of a student or employee with a communicable disease that is not spread by casual contact shall be required to treat all medical information about the student/employee, proceedings, deliberations, and documents as <i>confidential information</i>.&#160;&#160;Records of the proceedings and the decisions shall be kept by the Superintendent in a sealed envelope with access limited to only those persons receiving the consent of the parent/guardian or infected person, in accordance with state or federal law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Before any medical information is shared with anyone in the school setting, a <i>Need to Know</i> review shall be made which includes the parent/legal guardian, student if age 18 or over, employee or his/her representative, unless the information is required to meet the mandates of federal or state law or regulation, or Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL OF HEAD LICE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is the policy of the School Board to exclude from school any student suspected of having symptoms of head lice until satisfactory treatment has been given.&#160;&#160;The student shall be readmitted to school after the parent or guardian provides proof of treatment has been administered.&#160;&#160;Lice and/or eggs can no longer be present as determined by the school nurse.&#160;&#160;If days absent are excessive, the Supervisor of Child Welfare and Attendance shall determine if excessive absenteeism is excused or unexcused.</p>
