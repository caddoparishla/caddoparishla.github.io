Board is authorized in the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance of bonds or other obligations under the provisions of this Subpart to provide for the pledge of corporation franchise tax avails authorized to be pledged to the payment of such bonds or other obligations. All moneys remaining from the corporation franchise tax in each fiscal year after the treasurer of Louisiana shall have first set aside and paid over to issuing board the amounts required for the payment of principal of and interest on outstanding bonds issued by issuing board under the provisions of this Subpart, shall be transferred and paid to the special funds and General Fund of the State of Louisiana as required by law, but the payment of the principal of and interest on bonds issued hereunder by issuing board shall constitute a primary charge on said corporation franchise tax avails subject only to prior bonds and pledges as herein defined, and shall have priority over all other claims of whatever nature, upon the avails of corporation franchise tax. Bonds herein authorized may be issued from time to time as funds are necessary to construct facilities under 1963 Act. All bonds issued hereunder shall rank on a parity, and shall be payable from the same corporation franchise tax avails pledged and dedicated to the payment of principal of and interest on any bonds issued hereunder, provided, however, that the maximum amount to be pledged on account of the principal, interest, and reserve requirements with respect to all bonds issued hereunder, shall, in the aggregate, not exceed the sum of $650,000 in any fiscal year. The legislature may from time to time increase the limitation above the sum of $650,000 in any fiscal year provided in the preceding sentence without violating contractual agreements with bondholders.</p>
