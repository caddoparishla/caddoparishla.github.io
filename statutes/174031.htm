<p>A. The purpose of the program established in this Section is to provide certain students with exceptionalities the opportunity to attend schools of their parents' choosing that provide educational services that specifically address the needs of such students.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>B. (1) The School Choice Program for Certain Students with Exceptionalities, hereinafter referred to as the "program", is hereby established in each parish having a population in excess of one hundred ninety thousand persons according to the most recent federal decennial census.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(c) The student is not deemed to be gifted or talented.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>C. (1) The state Department of Education, hereafter in this Part referred to as the "department", shall administer and provide for implementation of the program pursuant to rules and regulations developed and adopted for such purpose by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.&#160;&#160;Such rules and regulations shall include procedures and guidelines permitting a parent or guardian of an eligible student who chooses to enroll the student in an eligible nonpublic school as provided in Subsection D of this Section to apply for an educational certificate, which is to be applied to the cost of educational services offered by the school and which is redeemable by the school from the department upon verification from the school that the student is enrolled in the school.&#160;&#160;The value of each certificate shall be determined by the department;&#160;&#160;the value shall be equivalent to fifty percent of the per pupil allocation of state funds to the city, parish, or other local public school district in which the eligible student is residing for that school year but shall not exceed the amount of tuition charged by the eligible nonpublic school.&#160;&#160;The funds to be paid for a certificate shall be divided into four equal payments to be made to each participating school in September, November, February, and May of each school year.&#160;&#160;Payments shall be based on per pupil count dates as determined by the department.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) Any cost of educational services above the amount of the certificate issued to the parent or guardian shall not be paid by the state.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) In accordance with time lines as determined by the department, each eligible nonpublic school choosing to participate in the program shall inform the department of the types of student exceptionalities as defined in R.S. 17:1942 that the school is willing to serve.&#160;&#160;Each school may determine the number of eligible students it will accept in any year of program participation and may establish criteria for enrollment of students.&#160;&#160;Each school shall have discretion in enrolling eligible students for participation in the program and no school shall be required to accept any eligible student.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
