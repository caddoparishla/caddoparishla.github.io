<p class="Title">SABBATICAL LEAVE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent may grant sabbatical leave for the purpose of professional or cultural improvement or for medical leave to all teaching personnel in accordance with statutory provisions.&#160;&#160;<i>Teaching personnel</i> shall include any person employed by the Caddo Parish School Board who holds a valid teaching certificate issued by the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education and any social worker, school counselor, school nurse, audiologist, education diagnostician, speech-language pathologist, or school psychologist employed by the School Board who holds the appropriate valid professional ancillary certificate issued by the Louisiana Department of Education.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ELIGIBILITY</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Sabbatical leave may be granted on the ratio of two (2) semesters for twelve (12) or more consecutive semesters of active service within the employ of this School Board or one (1) semester for six (6) or more consecutive semesters of such service.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At no time may more than five percent (5%) of the total number of teachers employed in a school system be on leave. &#160;Selection of employees among those who qualify for sabbatical leave must be based on years of continuous service and other criteria as specified by statute.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>MEDICAL SABBATICAL LEAVE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A teacher may make application for <i>medical sabbatical leave</i>, which shall be accompanied by a statement from a licensed physician certifying that the leave is medically necessary.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the Superintendent, upon review of the application, questions the validity or accuracy of the certification, the Superintendent may require the applicant, as a condition for continued consideration of the application, to be examined by a licensed physician selected by the Superintendent.&#160;&#160;In such a case, the School Board shall pay all costs of the examination and any tests determined to be necessary.&#160;&#160;If the physician finds a medical necessity, the leave application shall be granted.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the physician disagrees with the certification of the physician selected by the applicant, then the Superintendent may require the applicant, as a condition for continued consideration of the application, to be examined by a third licensed appropriate physician whose name appears next in the rotation of physicians on a list established by the local medical society for such purpose and maintained by the School Board.&#160;&#160;All costs of an examination and any required tests by a third physician shall be paid by the School Board.&#160;&#160;The opinion of the third physician shall decide the issue.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The opinion of all physicians consulted shall be submitted in the form of a <b><i>sworn statement</i></b>.&#160;&#160;All information contained in any statement from a physician shall be confidential and shall not be subject to the public records law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SABBATICAL LEAVE FOR PROFESSIONAL OR CULTURAL IMPROVEMENT</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Every person on sabbatical leave for the purpose of professional or cultural improvement, shall during each semester of leave, pursue a program of study, earning at least nine (9) undergraduate credit hours, provided such hours directly improve the person's skills and knowledge as a teacher, or six (6) graduate credit hours, or be certified as a full-time student at an institution of higher learning accredited by the respective State Board of Education or territorial board in which such institution is located.&#160;&#160;If less than fifteen (15) weeks is spent as specified above, the number of weeks less than fifteen (15) shall be spent in either of the two (2) alternatives specified below:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Pursue a program of independent study, research, authorship or investigation which involves an approximately equivalent amount of work and which is <i>approved by the School Board</i>.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage in travel which is so planned as to be of definite educational value and which has been <i>approved by the School Board</i>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Final authority for granting such leave shall rest with Superintendent.</p>

<li>
<p>Any person who receives a position to the Louisiana Department of Education, to another public school system within the State of Louisiana, or to a state-operated educational agency.&#160;&#160;In such instances, the person granted sabbatical leave, upon the expiration of leave, shall be permitted to retain that portion of compensation paid by the state while he/she was on leave.&#160;&#160;However, such person shall be required to reimburse the School Board any compensation paid by the School Board while on leave.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incapacitating illness or disability, as certified by two (2) physicians.&#160;&#160;(Superintendent reserves right to verify validity of request).<br />
