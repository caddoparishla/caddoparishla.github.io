<p style="text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;">(3) A statement from a teacher certified to teach at the child's grade level that the teacher has examined the program being offered and that, in his professional opinion, the child is being taught in accordance with a sustained curriculum of quality at least equal to that offered by public schools at the same grade level or, in the case of children with mental or physical disabilities, at least equal to that offered by public schools to children with similar disabilities.&#160;&#160;Any such teacher evaluation provided for in this Subsection shall be subject to review and approval of the State Board of Education.</p>
