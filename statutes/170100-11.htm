The provisions of R.S. 33:2955 and R.S. 49:321 are applicable to such accounts. Investment and interest earnings generated on funds in a school facility account shall be credited to the account and shall not be transferred to another account or used for purposes other than those allowable for funds in the school facility account.

All expenditures shall be in accordance with law and policies developed by the school board. The school board shall develop policies defining an emergency and the protocol a school must follow in expending funds in the school facility account for emergency repairs. Expenditures for planned capital repairs, improvements, and replacements and finance costs associated with such expenditures shall be approved in advance by the charter school’s board if the school is a charter school and the school board. Expenditures for planned capital repairs and replacements shall reflect the appropriate priorities as reflected in the school’s long-term capital plan developed pursuant to Paragraph (5) of this Subsection.&#160;</font></span></p>

After the retirement of such bonds, the operator of the school is responsible for updating such plans, subject to requirements developed by the school board and the approval of the school facilities office. Such plans shall include but need not be limited to identifying key building components and when they will likely need to be repaired or replaced and the estimated cost of doing so.&#160;</font></span></p>

The loan shall be made only from excess fund balances or other funds not designated for instructional purposes from the school holding the school facility account or another school under the same operator. All such loans shall be interest-free. If the school tenant of a campus with an outstanding loan to the school facility account changes, the new school tenant must pay back the loan under the same terms as the prior tenant. If a school is lending money to the school facility account, the loan may be repaid with funds from the school facility account, just as if the school had borrowed money from the revolving loan fund, as provided for in Subsection F of this Section. The school board shall develop policies to address repayment of the loan in the event the campus is no longer occupied by a school.&#160;</font></span></p>

Prior to any such action, the school board shall give formal notice to the school and provide an opportunity for it to remedy the deficiency, all in accordance with policies governing such procedures.&#160;</font></span></p>

A school facility account is campus-specific and remains with the campus should the school tenant of the campus change or should the school tenant no longer occupy the campus. However, if a campus is no longer to be used as a school, funds in the school facility account for that campus shall be used or redistributed in accordance with school board policies, which shall ensure that such funds are used for the benefit of campuses in the school district.&#160;</font></span></p>

(1) The school board shall create a facilities office. From annual facility funds, it shall use twenty dollars per pupil attending school at a campus in the school district or whatever lesser amount is available after payments pursuant to Subsection C of this Section to fund the facilities office. The school board may adjust this per pupil amount on an annual basis by the lesser of the most recent annual increase in the Consumer Price Index published by the United States Department of Labor or in the minimum foundation program funds.&#160;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000;"><font size="2" color="black" style="font-size:10.000000pt;">(a) Inspect and monitor facilities to ensure that they are being maintained and that each campus is in compliance with maintenance and inspection requirements. If a school is not properly maintaining its campus as required in the lease agreement, the school board may suspend or terminate use of the school facility account funds as provided in Paragraph (C)(8) of this Section or perform necessary maintenance, repair, or replacement work and charge the school the costs of such work plus a service fee. Prior to performing any such work, the school board shall give formal notice to the school and provide an opportunity for it to remedy the deficiency, all in accordance with policies governing such procedures.&#160;</font></span></p>

(1) Until all bonds referenced in Paragraph (A)(3) of this Section are retired, the school board shall use facility funds remaining after the allocation provided for in Subsection D of this Section for emergency repairs and replacements in accordance with policies it adopts for such purpose and for development of capital plans by the school facilities office as provided for in Paragraph (C)(5) of this Section. No more than one million five hundred thousand dollars of these funds shall be used to fund the development of such capital plans.&#160;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>

In the first year following retirement of the bonds, fifty million dollars or whatever lesser amount of facility funds remains shall be deposited into the revolving loan fund. If funds remain after this deposit of fifty million dollars, the school board shall determine the distribution of any remaining funds to the revolving loan fund and the capital improvement fund.
