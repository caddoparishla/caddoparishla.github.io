<p class="PdfParaStyle04">17:3825 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Teacher Incentive Pay Models Program; establishment</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;A. There is hereby established the Teacher Incentive Pay Models Program.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;B. Not later than September 15th, 1985, the department shall invite in writing each local system to submit to the department a proposal for a teacher incentive pay pilot program. The written invitation to submit proposals shall be accompanied by guidelines concerning the requirements for submission of such proposals and an explanation of the program created by this Chapter. The guidelines shall be approved by the board prior to their distribution and shall contain information concerning what creditable research done throughout the country indicates are elements of a successful teacher incentive pay program and any other information the board deems advisable or helpful.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;C. The department shall consider and evaluate each proposal submitted and recommend to the board not more than thirty proposals which meet the requirements in R.S. 17:3826. The board shall select not more than ten of the proposals submitted by the department which in the opinion of the board, after receiving recommendations from the committee, appear to have the highest potential for making meaningful improvement in the quality of education in this state. The local systems which submit approved proposals shall receive notice of such approval not later than January 15th, 1986 and shall receive from the department a grant of not more than thirty thousand dollars to fund the completion of the pilot program plan and to fund its implementation for the 19861987 school year.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;D. Each school system to which a grant is made shall submit to the board, for its approval, not later than April 15th, 1986, a complete pilot program plan, pursuant to R.S. 17:3826. After receiving the board's approval, each such local system shall implement its pilot program during the 19861987 school year. Not later than June 30th, 1987, each such local system shall submit a final report on the results of its program, as required by R.S. 17:3826(C) to the board. At the time of submitting a final report, each local system may make a request to continue the pilot program with whatever changes the system deems necessary.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;E. From among those local systems which make a request to continue their pilot programs for another year, the board shall select not more than three systems. Each local system approved for continuance pursuant to this Subsection shall receive notice of such approval not later than August 1st, 1987 and shall receive from the department a grant of not more than thirty thousand dollars to continue the pilot program for the 19871988 school year.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;F. Not later than June 30th, 1988 each local school system which conducted a pilot program during the 19871988 school year shall submit a final report to the board.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;G. The board shall review and evaluate the pilot programs conducted under this Chapter during the 19871988 school year and may consider other programs. Using the information gained from all the pilot programs conducted pursuant to this program, the board shall select one program conducted during the 19871988 school year and require the department to use it as a model to design a teacher incentive pay program for full statewide implementation, modifying it as necessary.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;H. The board shall present the statewide teacher incentive pay program designed pursuant to Subsection G of this Section in writing to the governor and the Senate and House of Representatives committees on education, along with supporting documentation resulting from the preliminary pilot programs. The board shall not implement such a program without a prior legislative enactment.</p>
