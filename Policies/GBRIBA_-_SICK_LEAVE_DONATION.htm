<p class="Title">DONATION OF EMPLOYEE SICK LEAVE DAYS (SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It shall be the policy of the Caddo Parish School Board to allow its employees to donate sick leave days to other employees who are suffering from a serious health condition as defined in this policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PART I.&#160;&#160;DEFINITIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Board</i> - Shall mean the Caddo Parish School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Employee</i> - Shall mean any person who is employed full-time by the Caddo Parish School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Employee’s Daily Rate of Pay</i> – Shall mean the employee’s rate of pay as determined by the Payroll Department</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Employee Donee</i> - Shall mean any person who is employed full-time by the School Board who is personally suffering from a Serious Health Condition or is a primary care-giver to a family member with a Serious Health Condition.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Employee Donor</i> - Shall mean any person who is employed full-time by the Caddo Parish School Board that desires to donate his or her sick leave days to an Employee Donee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Family Member</i> - Shall mean the Employee Donee’s husband, wife, son, or daughter; also means the Employee Donee’s father or mother if they reside with the Employee Donee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Serious Health Condition</i> - Shall mean an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, residential medical care facility or continuing treatment by a health care provider.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Long Term Inpatient Care</i> – Shall mean either (1) inpatient care provided for more than seven (7) consecutive days or (2) inpatient care for a series of inpatient treatments for the same or similar serious health condition that results in the Employee Donee’s exhaustion of all available compensable leave.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Sick Leave Donation Form</i> - Shall mean the <i>Sick Leave Act of Donation Form</i> established by the Caddo Parish School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PART II.&#160;&#160;REQUIREMENTS FOR DONATION OF SICK LEAVE DAYS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Employee Donee</i> - Employee Donee or Family Member must suffer a Serious Health Condition verified by his/her treating physician.&#160;&#160;Employee Donee may not receive donations of sick leave days from other Caddo Parish School Board employees unless the Employee Donee has exhausted all compensable leave days (vacation leave, sick leave, extended leave, catastrophic leave, medical sabbatical leave, etc.) available to the Employee Donee.&#160;&#160;Employee Donee must be (1) personally suffering from a serious health condition or (2) a primary caregiver to a family member that is suffering from a serious health condition.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Employee Donor</i> - Only persons employed full-time by the School Board with accumulated unused sick leave in excess of 25 days may make a donation of sick leave days to another full-time employee.&#160;&#160;In order for an Employee Donor to donate leave time to an Employee Donee, the Employee Donor’s daily rate of pay must be equal to or greater than the Employee Donee’s daily rate of pay. &#160;Once the sick leave days have been accepted by the Employee Donee, and approved by administration, such sick leave days are removed from the Employee Donor’s accumulated sick leave balance and may be used by the Employee Donee.&#160;&#160;Donated sick leave days will be subtracted from the accumulated sick leave of the Employee Donor which will reduce the Employee Donor’s retirement credit and may reduce the Employee Donor’s severance pay.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PART III.&#160;&#160;APPROVAL OF DONATION BY ADMINISTRATION</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p>Once the act of donation (Form 1) has been properly executed by the Employee Donor and accepted by the Employee Donee, the donation form must be submitted to the appropriate personnel director (Certified or Classified) based on the Employee Donee’s status.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The appropriate personnel director shall determine whether the Employee Donee is eligible to receive donated sick leave days and whether the Employee Donor is eligible to donate sick leave days.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order for Employee Donee to be eligible to receive sick leave days the following criteria must be met:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<div style="list-style: upper-alpha; margin-left: 2em">
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">

<br /></p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p>Once the appropriate personnel director has evaluated the information provided in Paragraphs C and D above, he shall notify the Employee Donor, Employee Donee and payroll of the approval and the number of sick leave days approved for transfer from the Employee Donor to the Employee Donee.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the appropriate personnel director denies or disapproves the transfer of sick leave days, he shall notify the Employee Donor and Employee Donee, in writing, no later than five days after the donation form is submitted to his office for approval.&#160;&#160;The notice shall be based solely on the criteria referred to in Part III C and D.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Employee Donee disagrees with the decision of the personnel director, the employee may appeal to Superintendent or the Superintendent’s designee, in writing, no later than five (5) days after the personnel director mails the written notice of denial.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
