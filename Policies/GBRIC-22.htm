<p class="Title">MATERNITY AND ADOPTIVE LEAVE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>MATERNITY LEAVE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board declares that any employee who becomes pregnant shall be eligible for maternity leave (leave without pay).&#160;&#160;The expectant employee shall be given the option of choosing maternity leave or using current and accumulated sick leave for the period of medical disability occasioned by pregnancy and childbirth.&#160;&#160;Use of current and/or accumulated sick leave for maternity leave purposes shall be in accordance with all policies, regulations and procedures affecting sick leave.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Maternity leave of absence (leave without pay) may be granted to regularly employed women for a reasonable time before and after childbirth for a maximum of one year. <i>Reasonable period of time</i> means that period during which the female employee is disabled on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.&#160;&#160;<i>Regular employees,</i> for purposes of this policy, shall mean full time employees (not to include substitute teachers or teachers replacing others on leave) and other female employees who are employed by the School Board on a regular basis.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Maternity leave without pay shall not affect tenure, teaching or working experience acquired prior to the leave.&#160;&#160;Maternity leave granted only for the period of disability occasioned by pregnancy and/or childbirth shall not interrupt the consecutive service for sabbatical leave purposes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each <i>full time employee</i> granted maternity leave in accordance with state law who has no remaining sick leave days available may also be granted up to thirty (30) days of extended sick leave in each six-year period of employment in accordance with policy <i><a href="GBRIB-23b.htm">GBRIB, Sick Leave</a></i>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>APPLICATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A pregnant employee may remain on the job as long as she is performing her duties competently as determined by her immediate supervisor.&#160;&#160;The employee shall fill out a <i>Maternity Leave Request</i> form, giving as much advance notice as possible, but in no case less than thirty (30)days prior to the beginning date of leave, except in emergency situations.&#160;&#160;The form must be accompanied by a statement from a physician verifying the stage of pregnancy and expected dates of disability due to pregnancy.&#160;&#160;Such certificate shall follow the same standards as for submission of certificates for sick leave as found under <i>Certification of Absence</i> in policy <i><a href="GBRIB-23b.htm">GBRIB, Sick Leave</a></i>.&#160;&#160;Failure to comply with the notice and other requirements of this policy may be considered willful neglect of duty and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>RETURN TO WORK</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Prior to returning to work, the employee must provide a physician’s statement to the Human Resources Department.&#160;&#160;The Human Resources Department shall provide the employee with a <i>Return to Work</i> form which shall be presented to the employee’s immediate supervisor prior to being allowed to return to work.&#160;&#160;The immediate supervisor shall be responsible for making sure that the appropriate form has been processed prior to the employee being allowed to return.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>CONSECUTIVE LEAVES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Regularly employed pregnant employees shall be eligible for consecutive maternity leave, time and other factors applying as for single maternity leaves within the guidelines of the <i>Family Medical Leave Act</i> and other School Board leave policies.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ADOPTIVE LEAVE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall grant leaves of absence not to exceed thirty (30) days to regular employed teachers after the legal adoption of a child.&#160;&#160;If multiple children are adopted on the same date, the event shall be considered a single qualifying event.&#160;&#160;The granting of such leave shall not affect any of the tenure rights with the teacher may have acquired under state law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each employee granted adoptive leave in accordance with state law who has no remaining sick leave days available may also be granted up to thirty (30) days of extended sick leave in each six-year period of employment for personal illness related to illness of an infant, or for required medical visits certified by a physician as relating to infant health.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Adoptive leave shall not interrupt the consecutive service for sabbatical leave purposes.</p>
