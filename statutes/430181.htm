<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. (1) The governing authority of political subdivisions or the official charged with the selection may annually select an auxiliary official journal for a term not exceeding one year. An auxiliary official journal shall be a newspaper which has been published in an office physically located in the parish in which the body is located for a period of five years preceding the selection.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(2) The newspaper:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(a) Shall not have missed during that period as many as three consecutive issues unless caused by fire, flood, strike, or natural disaster;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(b) Shall have maintained a general paid circulation in the parish in which the body is located for five years prior to the selection; and</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(c) Shall have been entered in a U.S. post office in that parish under a periodical permit in that parish for a period of five consecutive years prior to the selection.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(3) Selection of an auxiliary official journal shall be confined to those cities in excess of one hundred thousand population.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(4) The provisions of this Section relating to the five year requirement shall not contravene any contract existing between any governing body and a newspaper on and prior to May 11, 1970; nor shall the five year requirement herein be applied in assessing the qualifications of a newspaper which was in existence on May 11, 1970.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. In each instance where the governing authority of a political subdivision is required by law to publish more than one notice, advertisement, legal notice, judicial advertisement, or other publication in an official journal or otherwise, the governing authority of the political subdivision or the official charged with the selection may elect to publish one of the required publications in an auxiliary official journal at a rate not exceeding the rate to publish the same in the official journal; and, the said publication shall constitute publication in an official journal for the purposes of any law.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;C. In addition to publishing the publications required by law, the governing authority of a political subdivision or the official charged with the selection may elect to publish the required publication for any public purpose in an auxiliary official journal not in excess of the number of times required for the official publication and at a rate not exceeding the rate for publication of the same in the official journal, and said additional publications made pursuant to this Subsection shall not constitute official publications.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;D. Political subdivisions may appropriate and spend funds pursuant to the authority granted in this Section.</p>
