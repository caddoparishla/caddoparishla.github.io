(1)(a) If the operator of a motor vehicle is unable to show compliance with the provisions of this Part by displaying the required document when requested to do so, the motor vehicle shall be impounded and the operator shall be issued a notice of noncompliance with the provisions of this Part on a form to be provided by the department. Notwithstanding the provisions of R.S. 32:852(E), such notice may be sent by first class mail. A copy of the notice of noncompliance shall be provided to the towing or storage company and a copy shall be forwarded to the office of motor vehicles within three calendar days after the notice of noncompliance was served. The notice of noncompliance shall serve as notice of administrative hearings rights. In addition, the law enforcement officer shall remove the license plate from the vehicle if the vehicle is registered in Louisiana. The law enforcement officer shall deliver the vehicle license plate to the chief of the agency which employs the officer, or to a person in that agency designated to receive such license plates. In those cases in which a motor vehicle is not impounded, a copy of the notice of noncompliance shall be attached to the vehicle license plate and both shall be delivered to the nearest office of motor vehicles within three calendar days after the notice of noncompliance was served.&#160;</font></span></p>

If the vehicle was properly insured at the time the notice was issued, any valid license plate shall be returned within forty-eight hours, exclusive of legal holidays, to the owner of the vehicle at no cost to the owner. However, if, within sixty days from the date the notice of noncompliance is issued, the owner fails to provide proof of the fact that the vehicle was properly insured at the time the notice of noncompliance was issued, the chief administrative officer of the office of motor vehicles shall destroy, or shall cause to be destroyed, the license plate removed from that owner’s vehicle and shall notify the secretary that the owner of the vehicle is not in compliance with the compulsory liability law. Upon receipt of such notification, the secretary shall revoke the registration of such vehicle. Sixty days after the date of issuance of the notice of noncompliance, the fees imposed in this Section shall be owed even if the owner subsequently provides proof the motor vehicle was insured, and all such fees shall be considered final delinquent debt.&#160;</font></span></p>

The sticker shall bear the date upon which it was issued in written or stamped numerals or letters not less than three inches in height.

To this end, no license shall be taken or destroyed pursuant to the authority granted in Paragraph (1) of this Subsection until such rules are properly promulgated in accordance with law. However, this limitation shall not be construed so as to otherwise limit the enforcement of laws relative to operating a vehicle without proper insurance or security.&#160;</font></span></p>

The records of the department on the particular violation shall be prima facie proof of the violation, and the owner or operator shall have the burden of proving that the vehicle was covered by a valid policy of insurance or was self-insured pursuant to this Chapter at the time of the violation. The owner or operator may subpoena any witness to appear at the hearing, including the officer issuing the violation, to establish that the owner or operator was in compliance with the law at the time of the alleged violation. A request for a hearing shall not stay the sanctions required by this Part. If it is determined at the administrative hearing that the vehicle was covered by a valid policy of insurance or was self-insured pursuant to this Chapter at the time of the violation, but that such proof was not presented to the law enforcement officer at the time the vehicle was impounded, then the vehicle owner shall be required to pay the storage and wrecker fees of the person or company who impounded and towed the subject vehicle.&#160;</font></span></p>

Any action for judicial review of the decision from the administrative hearing shall be in the same manner and under the same conditions as provided in R.S. 32:414. No court shall issue an injunction, stay or other process preventing the enforcement of the sanctions required by this Part pending the hearing provided for in this Part, except as provided by R.S. 49:964.&#160;</font></span></p>

Upon expiration of the sticker, the vehicle shall not be driven until the owner has complied with the requirements of this Section.

The legislature hereby declares that the presence of a current license plate on a motor vehicle has become one indication that the motor vehicle is covered by liability security. The legislature further declares that the provisions of R.S. 47:505(B) which require owners of motor vehicles to surrender the license plates of motor vehicles when the lawful use of the motor vehicle by the owner has terminated has become an integral part of the enforcement of the laws requiring all motor vehicles to be covered by liability security. In order to inform the public of the requirements of R.S. 47:505(B) and to facilitate the enforcement of the laws requiring motor vehicle liability security, the office of motor vehicles shall provide notice of the requirements of R.S. 47:505(B) to each person to whom a motor vehicle registration is delivered or transmitted.&#160;</font></span></p>

If the owner of the vehicle is the minor child, the parents of the minor child shall be jointly subject to the provisions of this Section along with the minor child, unless the minor has been adjudicated emancipated, or is in the sole custody of another or only one parent under the law. If the minor is in the sole custody of another or only one parent under the law, the person or parent in whose sole custody the child has been placed will be jointly responsible with the minor child under this Section.&#160;</font></span></p>
