<p class="Title">REDUCTION OF PERSONNEL</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It shall be the policy of the Caddo Parish School Board to maintain a fair and balanced educational program consistent with the functions and responsibilities of public schools. When faced with circumstances which may necessitate a reduction of personnel greater than can be accomplished through attrition and appropriate reassignment, a reduction of personnel action may be employed.&#160;&#160;All feasible alternatives to the layoffs of employees shall be considered prior to the implementation of the provisions stated herein.&#160;&#160;The determination for the need to implement reduction of personnel procedures and all decisions effecting such action shall be made by the Superintendent. &#160;Seniority and/or tenure shall not be the primary criteria when instituting a Reduction in Force.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided herein, any existing procedure for reconsidering or examining an employee discharge, non-reappointment, or grievance shall not be considered in implementing a reduction of personnel action. &#160;Similarly, no personnel action other than a reduction of personnel may be considered under this policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees on School Board approved leaves of absence shall be treated in the same manner as other regularly employed personnel insofar as application of this policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Reduction of teachers and administrators shall be based <b>solely</b> upon demand, performance, and effectiveness, as determined by the performance evaluation program adopted by the School Board in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§17:3881 through 3905.&#160;&#160;Any reduction of teachers and administrators by the Superintendent shall be instituted by dismissing the least effective teacher within each targeted subject area or area of certification first, and then proceeding by effectiveness rating until the reduction of personnel has been accomplished.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Seniority and/or tenure shall not be the primary criteria when instituting a Reduction in Force.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ALL OTHER EMPLOYEES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Reduction of school employees, including bus drivers, who are <b>not</b> evaluated pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§17:3881 through 3905, shall be based upon the following criteria:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Performance and effectiveness as determined by the School Board’s personnel evaluation plan.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certification or academic preparation, if applicable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>NOTICE TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When a reduction of personnel action is instituted, written notice of termination shall be given by the Superintendent or his/her designee by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the employee to be terminated.&#160;&#160;The notice shall include a statement of the general conditions requiring a reduction of personnel.&#160;&#160;The employee’s address, as it appears on the School Board’s record, shall be deemed to be the correct address.&#160;&#160;It shall be the employee’s responsibility to see that the School Board has his/her current address on file.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL TERMINATIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after receiving a notice of termination, an employee may request, in writing, a review of the action taken and shall receive notice of the results of the review in a timely manner, but no later than ten (10) days after the notice to review is received. &#160;The employee shall have the right to pursue a reduction action through the School Board’s grievance procedures.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>RECALL PROCEDURES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For three (3) years after the effective date of a termination, the employee shall be given the first opportunity to be reinstated to the position from which terminated.&#160;&#160;Employees shall be recalled in reverse order to their lay-off.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The offer of re-employment shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, and the employee shall be notified that, if he/she wishes to accept, he/she must do so in writing within seven (7) calendar days.&#160;&#160;Failure to accept within seven (7) calendar days or rejection of the position eliminates all re-employment rights of the employee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>An employee who is recalled within three (3) years after being laid off shall have restored to him/her all of the sick leave and unused personal leave, if applicable, he/she had accrued on the effective date of the layoff.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If any provision of this policy or the application thereof is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions of this policy which can be implemented without the invalid provisions and, to this end, the provisions of this policy are hereby declared severable.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any and all provisions of this policy shall yield to existing state law, whether statutory or not, when held to be in conflict with said law or laws.</p>
