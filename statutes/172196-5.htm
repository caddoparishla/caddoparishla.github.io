<p class="PdfParaStyle04">17:2196.5 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bonds</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;Bonds issued under the provisions of this SubPart C shall be solely the obligations of the issuing board and not the State of Louisiana, and shall contain a recital to that effect. The principal and interest of said bonds, irrespective of the dates of issuance thereof, shall be payable, on a parity with outstanding bonds previously authorized and issued under the provisions of this SubPart. The payment of the principal and interest of said bonds shall be a first charge upon corporation franchise tax avails subordinate only to prior bonds and pledges, and the Treasurer of the State of Louisiana shall, in each fiscal year, set aside and pay over to the issuing board from corporation franchise tax avails for the payment of the principal of and the interest on all bonds issued under the authority of this SubPart, which may then be outstanding, the aggregate amount of the principal and interest due thereon in such fiscal year. The amounts received from the state treasurer out of corporation franchise tax in each fiscal year, subject to prior bonds and pledges, shall be irrevocably and irrepealably pledged and dedicated to the payment of the principal of and the interest on all outstanding bonds issued under the provisions of this SubPart C. Said bonds shall mature at such time or times as the issuing board shall determine within thirty (30) years from their date of issue, and shall bear interest at a rate or rates not exceeding five per centum (5%) per annum, payable semiannually, and shall be in such denominations and form, with such provisions for registration as to principal, or as to principal and interest, and reconversion as the issuing board shall determine, and shall be redeemable at such time or times and with or without such redemption premiums as shall be determined by the issuing board and set forth in said bonds. Issuing board may in the resolution authorizing bonds hereunder, provide for the initial issuance of a single bond representing the entire amount of an issue or bonds of various denominations representing designated blocks or portions of an issue. The issuing board may in any such resolution make such provision for installment payments of the principal amount of such single bond or bonds as it may consider desirable, and may provide for the making of such bond or bonds registrable as to principal or as to both principal and interest, and where interest accruing thereon is not represented by interest coupons for the endorsing of payments of interest on the bond or bonds. The issuing board may further make provision in any such resolution for the manner and circumstances in and under which such single bond or bonds may in the future at the request of the holder or holders be converted into bonds of small denominations, which bonds of small denominations may in turn be either coupon bonds or bonds registrable as to principal or principal and interest. Such resolution may also provide for the creation of reserve funds to be used for preventing or remedying a default in the payment of principal and interest on bonds authorized hereunder. The principal and interest of said bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America at the office of the Treasurer of the State of Louisiana, in the city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, or a bank designated by the original purchaser at the option of the holder. Said bonds shall be sold to the highest bidder upon sealed proposals at public sale for not less than par and accrued interest after advertisement published at least ten (10) days in advance of the date of sale in newspapers or financial journals published in the cities of New Orleans, Louisiana, and New York, New York, reserving to said issuing board the right to reject any and all bids, and the right to readvertise for new bids in the manner herein provided. Issuing board by resolution may provide for the issuance of temporary bonds under the terms and conditions it shall determine.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;No proceedings or approvals with respect to such bonds or the issuance and sale thereof shall be necessary except such as are contemplated by this SubPart C, and interest on said bonds issued under this SubPart is exempt from all taxation in Louisiana.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;The bonds authorized to be issued hereunder shall be signed by the issuing board's presiding officer and by its secretary, or with the facsimile signature of its presiding officer, attested by its secretary. Any coupons attached to said bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the secretary of the issuing board. Said bonds are hereby declared to have the qualities of negotiable instruments under the law of Louisiana, and shall not be invalid for any irregularity or defect in the proceedings for the issuance and sale thereof, and shall be incontestable in the hands of bona fide purchasers or holders thereof.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;The corporate existence of LSU board and state board, herein declared to be bodies politic, shall continue until all the bonds or other obligations issued under the provisions of this SubPart and the interest thereon shall have been fully paid and retired. So long as any of the bonds issued hereunder are outstanding and unpaid, the proceeds of the corporation franchise tax shall continue to be levied and collected and no laws shall be adopted by the Legislature of Louisiana affecting adversely the collection thereof, and subject to prior bonds and pledges the proceeds of said tax shall be irrevocably and irrepealably pledged and dedicated to the payment of the principal of and interest on bonds issued under the provisions of this SubPart.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;The proceeds of the bonds herein authorized to be issued and sold shall be deposited in a special construction fund with issuing board, and shall be disbursed as herein authorized by the issuing board.</p>
