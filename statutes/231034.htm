<p class="PdfParaStyle01">PART I SCOPE AND OPERATIONS</p>

<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to every person in the service of the state or a political subdivision thereof, or of any incorporated public board or commission authorized to hold property and to sue and be sued, under any appointment or contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written, except an official of the state or a political subdivision thereof or of any such incorporated public board or commission; and for such employee and employer the payment of compensation according to and under the terms, conditions, and provisions set out in this Chapter shall be exclusive, compulsory, and obligatory; provided that one employed by a contractor who has contracted with the state or other political subdivision, or incorporated public board or commission through its proper representative, shall not be considered an employee of the state, or other political subdivision, or incorporated public board or commission; further, provided that members of the police department, or municipal employees performing police services for any municipality who are not elected officials shall be covered by this Chapter and shall be eligible for compensation; and provided further that criminal deputy sheriffs for the parish of Orleans shall be covered by this Chapter and shall be eligible for compensation as provided herein.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. Except as expressly and specifically provided to the contrary in Subsection A hereof, the officials excepted from coverage under the provisions of this Chapter, in Subsection A of this Section, include all public officers as defined by R.S. 42:1. In this regard, sheriffs' deputies are, under R.S. 42:1, 33:1433, and 33:9001 et seq., appointed public officers and officials of their respective political subdivisions, the parish law enforcement districts.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;C. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A of this Section, any political subdivision may, in its own discretion and by using its own funds available for same, provide workers' compensation coverage for its officials, in addition to having to provide such coverage for its employees. When a political subdivision elects to provide workers' compensation for its officials, the provisions of R.S. 23:1032 regarding exclusiveness of remedies and employer's liability shall apply to any injury, illness, or disease compensable under this Chapter.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;D. Employees of the state, but not those of political subdivisions, shall be provided compensation under this Section by the office of risk management of the Division of Administration in accordance with R.S. 39:1527, et seq. For purposes of this Section, "employees of the state" means the employees of "state agencies" as defined by R.S. 39:1527(1). Employees of political subdivisions shall be provided compensation under this Section by the governing authorities of their respective political subdivisions. The fact that the state may grant to an employee of a political subdivision any additional or supplemental pay or otherwise provide funds for the payment of such employee's salary shall not make such employee, in whole or in part or in any way, an employee of the state.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;E. For the purposes of this Section, the compensation provided in Subsection A of this Section shall be the exclusive remedy when an employee of the state or a political subdivision incurs a compensable claim on the premises of another political subdivision who is required by law or cooperative endeavor agreement to provide the employer with the premises or amenities of the workplace. Neither the state nor any political subdivision, acting as an employer, shall have a subrogation claim against any other political subdivision for any compensable claim made by an employee.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;F. For purposes of this Section, "employees of political subdivisions" means the employees of all departments, districts, or agencies operating under the same governing authority.</p>
