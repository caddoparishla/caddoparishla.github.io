<p class="Title">STUDENT DRESS CODE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The policy of the Caddo Parish School Board shall be that no mode of attire shall be considered proper for school wear that disrupts the classroom and/or the school's positive learning environment.&#160;&#160;In questions regarding student dress and grooming, the principal or his/her designee of each school shall make the final decision as to what is considered proper or improper dress according to the guidelines provided.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>NOTIFICATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall notify the parent or guardian of each student of the dress code specifications and their effective date.&#160;&#160;The dress code shall be distributed in written form or posted on the school’s website annually.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the School Board adopts a uniform policy or modifies the existing uniform policy, it shall notify, in writing the parent or guardian of each student of the policy adoption or uniform policy modification at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the new or revised policy.&#160;&#160;Each school shall display any uniform selected for a reasonable period prior to the proposed effective date for wearing of the uniform.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>However, nothing shall prohibit the School Board from requiring a new or revised dress code or uniform policy without the required notice in the event of an emergency.&#160;&#160;For the purposes of this policy, <i>emergency</i> shall mean an actual or imminent threat to health or safety which may result in loss of life, injury, or property damage.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SCHOOL UNIFORMS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board may make school uniforms mandatory on a school-by-school basis either by School Board action, or school community action where survey results indicate agreement to make uniforms mandatory by a majority of parents (based on a 50% or greater return), faculty, and staff.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>The decision of the School Board or a school community to move to a mandatory uniform policy shall be done on a school-by-school basis.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A standard survey shall be used parishwide for school community action.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A timeline, approved by the Superintendent, shall be developed in the spring preceding the year of implementation.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once school uniforms are mandated on a school-by-school basis, uniforms shall be required for all students at that school.&#160;&#160;Exemptions may be granted only for the following:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<div style="list-style: upper-alpha; margin-left: 2em">
<ol start="1" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Physical disability or certified medical condition that prevents the wearing of all or part of the school uniform, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constitutionally protected rights.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<div start="1" style="list-style: decimal; margin-left: 2em">
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Parents may apply for an exemption by making a written request to the school principal no later than the month of May prior to the year of implementation.&#160;&#160;For new students moving into the school community during the school year, the exemption request must be completed within two (2) weeks following enrollment.</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>School uniforms, as defined in this policy, refer to conformity in student dress.&#160;&#160;Specific uniform attire shall be recommended by the school and approved by the Superintendent.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each school shall establish a committee, or use an existing school committee, to monitor the implementation of the policy.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each school principal shall be responsible to seek financial assistance, where necessary, from external sources when a determination is made that a student cannot be outfitted in the mandatory uniform due to extreme family financial hardship.&#160;&#160;The Superintendent shall be informed of any problems arising in meeting this standard.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Superintendent shall maintain administrative regulations for the enforcement of this policy, which shall contain an appeal procedure for parents whose exemption request has been denied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DRESS AND PERSONAL GROOMING</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Student dress and grooming are not to adversely affect the students' participation in classes, school programs, other school-related activities or detract from the learning environment of the school.&#160;&#160;Extremes in style and fit in student dress and extremes in style of grooming will not be permitted.&#160;&#160;Administrators are authorized to use their discretion in determining extremes in styles of dress and grooming and what is appropriate and suitable for school wear.&#160;&#160;No student shall wear, possess, use, distribute, display or sell any clothing, jewelry, emblem, blade, symbols, sign or other things which are evidence of affiliation with drugs, alcohol, violence or gang related activities or exhibits profane or obscene language/gestures.&#160;&#160;Beards and goatees shall be prohibited.&#160;&#160;Policies regarding dress and grooming stress the importance of reducing distractions that inhibit learning and are addressed as an attempt to enhance the learning environment.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall not exclude a student on account of a natural, protective or cultural hairstyle.&#160;&#160;<i>Natural, protective, or cultural hairstyle</i> shall include, but is not limited to, afros, dreadlocks, twists, locs, braids, cornrow braids, Bantu knots, curls, and hair styled to protect hair texture or for cultural significance.</p>
