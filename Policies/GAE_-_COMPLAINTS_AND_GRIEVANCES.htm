<p class="Title">COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The following grievance procedure is established to provide a way for the Caddo Parish School Board and its employees to resolve a grievance that may occur between them.&#160;&#160;It is the intent of this procedure to provide a simple, straightforward way to resolve grievances at the lowest possible administrative level, as fairly and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the School Board or by any member of the Administration against the grievant or any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Grievances should be processed in a manner that does not interfere with the employee's work and the normal operation of the school system.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is understood that employees have legitimate questions that pertain to their jobs and are not necessarily grievances.&#160;&#160;If it is determined that a claim brought pursuant to this policy does not meet the definition of grievance the employee shall be notified.&#160;&#160;The personnel department always stands ready to assist employees in finding solutions to their problems.</p>

<br /></p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>School Board Administrative Procedure</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Administration shall provide a copy of the superintendent’s or superintendent’s designee’s written recommendation for disposition of the grievance, a copy of the transcript, the grievance form and all reasons for decisions at all levels, all supporting, rebutting and investigation documentation at all levels, affidavits, and memorandum of counsel if applicable to the School Board and the grievant on the Monday one week prior to the appeal hearing date (mail out deadline).&#160;&#160;If the grievant would like to submit any additional documents (briefs or arguments only – no new evidence) for review by the School Board, they must present the documents to the Superintendent no later than noon on the Friday before the mail out deadline. &#160;All documents are to be maintained in confidence.&#160;&#160;All documents must be presented utilizing this process or the School Board will not consider the documents.&#160;&#160;The School Board appeal packet containing this information shall be made available to the School Board on BoardDocs or by hard copy as requested by School Board members.&#160;&#160;The Caddo Parish School Board will dispose of the grievance without argument from the parties unless the School Board votes otherwise.&#160;&#160;If the School Board votes to allow oral argument, the matter shall be rescheduled to allow the parties time to prepare.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Oral Argument</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the School Board allows oral argument, the following procedures shall be followed:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board President shall allow School Board counsel to outline all rules for participants and provide recommended rulings to the School Board regarding objections and other matters raised by the participants.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The grievant and administration will each have ten (10) minutes to present argument.&#160;&#160;Grievant shall make his/her argument first followed by administration.&#160;&#160;Grievant may reserve any portion of his/her argument time for rebuttal.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Once oral arguments are completed, the School Board President will ask each School Board member whether they have any questions of the grievant or administration.&#160;&#160;Questions are limited to two (2) questions per School Board member and are not intended to solicit evidence not presented in the School Board appeal packet.&#160;&#160;The School Board President will call on each School Board member who desires to ask a question.&#160;&#160;Appropriate decorum shall be maintained at all times.&#160;&#160;Inappropriate references to employees or their representatives shall not be allowed and will be called out of order and not tolerated.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board President shall then ask for the Superintendent’s recommendation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any person whose competency or character will be discussed shall be given notice at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the appeal hearing.&#160;&#160;Any person whose competency or character will be discussed shall have the opportunity to have the matter discussed in closed executive session.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Disposition</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board shall dispose of the grievance in open session.&#160;&#160;Once a motion is made to dispose of the grievance in open session, there shall be no discussion regarding the motion except to clarify the motion.&#160;&#160;The Caddo Parish School Board may affirm, reverse or modify the recommendation of the superintendent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>General Matters</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Whenever the Human Resources Executive director, superintendent or superintendent’s designee accesses the personnel file of a grievant, the Human Resources Executive Director, the Superintendent or Superintendent’s designee shall provide notice of the fact and the name and title of the person who was permitted access to the grievant’s personnel file.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the School Board will consider matters contained within the personnel file of the grievant, the School Board must vote to access the personnel file of the grievant unless the grievant consents to School Board member access and signs the appropriate waiver. &#160;If grievant does not consent to School Board member access, the School Board will place the matter on the agenda to vote regarding accessing the grievant’s personnel file at the next regularly scheduled School Board meeting.&#160;&#160;The School Board hearing will then be placed on the agenda for the following regularly scheduled School Board meeting.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual School Board members shall maintain confidentiality of the personnel documents accessed.&#160;&#160;Written notice regarding the School Board members’ access to the grievant’s personnel file shall be sent to the grievant.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A grievant is entitled to representation of his/her choice at all levels of these procedures after Level One.&#160;&#160;The grievant who chooses to have a representative, shall provide advance notice of the name of the representative and whether the representative is an attorney at least five (5) working days prior to a meeting or scheduled hearing.</p>
