<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board recognizes that there is certain student information that is inherently a part of the educational process that will necessarily result in third parties being privy to information while students are being educated such as classroom participation which necessarily allows other students to hear the responses of other students.&#160;&#160;Also, students may be otherwise used during the educational process.&#160;&#160;The School Board therefore declares that the superintendent may allow the disclosure of student information within and around its facilities in order to facilitate the educational process.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board also finds that the sharing of the following student information furthers a legitimate education purpose as provided for in La. Ag. Opinion No. 15-0103 dated July 29, 2015 and a parent or student who has reached the age of eighteen (18) years may authorize the disclosure:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p>student participation in various school sanctioned extracurricular activities, sports, organizations or clubs;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>student participation in programs and activities related to school sanctioned performances or productions, events, award programs and graduations;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">student authorization and utilization of online resources and educational tools;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for student participation in yearbook, school photography, or other publications containing school directory information; and<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>student receipt of various awards and honors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The superintendent shall require parental authorization for disclosure as necessary.&#160;&#160;Parental or student participation in the various programs as offered shall be deemed authorization for disclosure.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ANNUAL NOTIFICATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All parents/guardians shall be notified annually of their rights under the <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title20-section1232g&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim"><i>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974</i> (FERPA)</a> and applicable state law.&#160;&#160;Such notification shall be made annually by publication in student handbooks, newsletters, notification to student's home by students, by mail, or publication in the official journal or in such manner as deemed appropriate by the Caddo Parish School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DIRECTORY INFORMATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The school district may not disclose information simply because it is the type information that could be put in a directory.&#160;&#160;The information may be disclosed only if it is in a directory or publication such as a yearbook or school directory in accordance with FERPA requirements.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Information classified as <i>directory information</i> may be disclosed from a student's record without the written consent of the parent or eligible student.&#160;&#160;<i>Directory information</i> has been designated by the School Board to include the student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, grade level, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, most recent previous school attended and photograph or video.&#160;&#160;A parent or eligible student may refuse to allow the School Board to designate any or all of the types of information about the student as directory information thus prohibiting its release to the public.&#160;&#160;After proper notice, a parent or eligible student shall have thirty (30) days in which to notify the School Board as to which types of information about the student shall not be designated as directory information.&#160;&#160;A parent or student over the age of 18 years may, however, refuse to have their information placed in a directory or other publication if the directory/publication has not been printed.</p>
