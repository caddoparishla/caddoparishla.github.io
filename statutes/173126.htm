<p class="PlainText">&#160;</p>
<p>A. The Board of Regents shall have the power to approve, disapprove, or modify a proposed degree program, department of instruction, division or similar subdivision.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>B. No college or university may institute a new degree program or department of instruction, division, or similar subdivision without the final approval of the Board of Regents.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>C. (1) In exercising its power pursuant to this Section regarding program approval of institutions under the jurisdiction of the Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges, the Board of Regents shall include in any such consideration the need for broad citizen access to the education and training services provided by such institutions and shall endeavor to expand such access through use of all available resources, including programs which are provided through electronic transmission.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) The Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges shall determine the feasibility of establishing a means of awarding associate degrees and certificates below the rank of baccalaureate by using the instructional resources of existing institutions.&#160;&#160;The Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges may award such degrees, provided that the board and the Board of Regents agree that such awards are feasible and advantageous to the citizens of Louisiana and that sufficient appropriations are available for this purpose.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(3) The provision of any program subject to the supervision and management of and offered at any institution under the jurisdiction of the Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges which is not a degree program shall require no approval beyond that of the Board of Community and Technical Colleges.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(4) The Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges, with the approval of the Board of Regents, may enter into agreements or contract with the board having supervision and management of any public institution of higher education for the provision by any such institution of courses and services leading to an associate degree offered by the Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>D. (1) The Board of Regents shall formulate and establish geographic regions of the state in order to maximize the use of the instructional and physical resources of existing state postsecondary educational institutions and regionally accredited independent postsecondary educational institutions and to provide broad citizen access to the education and training services provided by such institutions.&#160;&#160;The board shall establish the regions such that at least one public institution of higher education which awards baccalaureate degrees shall be within the geographic boundaries of or shall be assigned by the Board of Regents to each region.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2)(a) The Board of Regents shall evaluate the instructional and physical resources of such existing institutions within each region, including the resources of existing higher education institutions, and shall assure maximum use thereof before recommending the creation of any new postsecondary institution within the region.&#160;&#160;The Board of Regents may provide for the use within a region of existing resources from outside the region before recommending the creation of any new postsecondary institution within the region.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(b) Such evaluation shall also be used by the board to create efficiencies, increase student access, enhance academic quality, further the goals established by the master plan for postsecondary education, and for any other purpose that will serve to advance postsecondary education in each region and the state as a whole.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(c) With the exception of those matters enumerated in Article VIII, Section 5 of the Constitution of Louisiana that require legislative approval, the Board of Regents shall adopt such policies and take such actions deemed appropriate and necessary to maximize the use of all resources available to support and promote postsecondary education in the state.</p>
