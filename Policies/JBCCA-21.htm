<p class="Title">ASSIGNMENT OF STUDENTS TO SCHOOLS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The following paragraph appears in the July, 1981 Consent Decree under which the Caddo Parish School Board is currently (September, 1981) operating:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Except for the reasons outlined in this paragraph (1), the School Board shall not permit a student to transfer out of a mandatory assignment school district.&#160;&#160;Transfers from a mandatory assignment school district may be made under the following circumstances: (i) majority to minority transfers as provided in Part 11, Section F of this Decree, (ii) attendance at a magnet or laboratory school within the guidelines set forth in Part 11 of this Decree, (iii) certified medical need, (iv) hardship and (v) curriculum necessity. Hardship and curriculum transfers shall be granted in a manner consistent with the goals of equal educational opportunity and quality education.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The principal of each school shall be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the attendance zone assignments for his or her school, and the central office staff shall develop administrative procedures.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students found out-of-district shall be returned to their district school immediately.&#160;&#160;No consideration will be given to an application of transfer for the remainder of the school year.&#160;&#160;Transfers must be renewed annually.&#160;&#160;M-M transfers shall remain in effect for a least one school year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When considering hardship type requests, a true distinction between mere inconvenience and hardship will be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In granting medical transfers, the central office staff shall have the authority to make placement assignments.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The majority-to-minority transfer (M-M) provision is employed as a device to further provide desegregated school experiences for both black and white students by voluntary means.&#160;&#160;The Caddo Parish School Board is entitled to establish reasonable rules and regulations consistent with that purpose, but also, consistent with the goals of equal educational opportunity, quality education and efficient administration.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board deems appropriate to the continuity of the efficient education of children that M-M transfers be placed into effect only at the beginning of each school year in the absence of exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Student transfer applications must be submitted by April 15. &#160;The only exceptions are listed as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Parent(s) or person with legal custody made a bona fide move either inside the parish or from another city to Caddo Parish April 15 or after.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child was enrolled in a private or parochial school on April 15.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A medical emergency substantiated by a physician's statement.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must be directly the cause of application's lateness.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parent(s) was/were notified that child could not return to a magnet program April 15 or later.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>M-M transfers should not be used as a device to circumvent disciplinary policies and procedures of the Caddo Parish School Board.&#160;&#160;The initiation of the transfer request procedure shall not terminate or interfere with any disciplinary procedures which may be in progress at the time of the request.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board will provide transportation for majority to minority transfer students to the school nearest their attendance zone to which the majority to minority transfer would apply.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students transferred majority to minority may remain through graduation or the highest grade if they desire even when the racial composition of the school changes and their race becomes the majority race, provided there is no change in that school district in which the student resides.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Transfers are not processed to schools on an M-M basis when the ratio of races is separated by less than one percent (1%).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students whose attendance zone assignments change after nine weeks of school shall be allowed to remain at the original school if they choose.&#160;&#160;Parents will be responsible for providing transportation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any student who is going to be a senior shall be allowed to remain at the high school presently enrolled and graduate with his/her class.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Executive Committee is authorized to act on behalf of the School Board on transfer appeals.&#160;&#160;The decision of the Executive Committee may be appealed to the School Board within ten days.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>RETURN TO NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL FOR CONDUCT VIOLATIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any student attending a school by reason of an M-M transfer, curriculum transfer or hardship transfer who receives two out of school suspensions within one single school year shall be returned to the neighborhood school in the student's original attendance zone at the beginning of the next school year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the contract signed by the student and/or the parent governing a student's attendance at a magnet school or a school with a magnet component, any student attending a magnet school or a school with a magnet component who receives two out of school suspensions within one single school year shall be returned to the neighborhood school in the student's attendance zone at the beginning of the next school year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Unless otherwise required by State or Federal law, any student expelled for violating state law and/or the student code of conduct shall be returned to the neighborhood school in the student's attendance zone after serving the expulsion term or upon approval of the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students who have been removed from a school based on this policy shall not be eligible for a M-M transfer, hardship transfer, curriculum transfer, magnet school or magnet component placement unless and until student has completed two full semesters at his neighborhood school.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Adopted:&#160;&#160;April 20, 2021</p>
