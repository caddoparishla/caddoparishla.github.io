<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall notify employees, students, and/or visitors through appropriate methods that video monitoring/surveillance may occur on School Board property, in buildings and facilities, as well as campuses, parking lots, and school grounds belonging to, leased, or used by the School Board, or on any vehicle owned, leased, or used to transport students or for conduction of School Board business, or at any school sponsored event, activity, or function.</p>
