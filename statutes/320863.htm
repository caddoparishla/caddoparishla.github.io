However, in no event shall these sanctions be removed until such time as proof of the required security is provided to the secretary along with all appropriate fees required by law, including a reinstatement fee of one hundred dollars per violation of Paragraph (1) of this Subsection if the vehicle was not covered by the required security for a period of one to thirty days, two hundred fifty dollars if the vehicle was not covered by required security for a period of thirty-one to ninety days, and five hundred dollars if the vehicle was not covered by required security for a period in excess of ninety days.
