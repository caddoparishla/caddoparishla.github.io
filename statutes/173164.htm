<p class="PdfParaStyle04">17:3164 &#160;Common course numbering system</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A. (1) In accordance with council policy, the Board of Regents shall develop, coordinate, and maintain a statewide course numbering system for postsecondary and dual enrollment education in all public secondary and postsecondary educational institutions as a means to facilitate program planning and the transfer of students and course credits between and among secondary and postsecondary educational institutions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2)(a) The development and ongoing maintenance of the statewide course numbering system, including determining course equivalencies, shall be accomplished with the assistance of appropriate committees that shall include faculty members representing public and participating nonpublic educational institutions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(b) The development and implementation of the statewide common course numbering system shall be prioritized as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(i) All courses contained in the general education core curriculum as established by the Board of Regents.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(ii) All courses required for completion of the associate of arts and associate of science transfer degrees.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(iii) All remaining lower division courses.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(iv) All remaining undergraduate courses.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>B. (1)(a) The commissioner of higher education, in collaboration with the higher education management boards, shall appoint faculty committees representing all participating institutions to recommend the appropriate level for each course, including postsecondary career and technical education courses, included in the statewide course numbering system.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(b) A course designated as an upper-division level course shall be characterized by a need for advanced academic preparation and skills that a student is unlikely to achieve without significant prior coursework.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(c) A course that is designated as a lower-division level course may be offered by any duly accredited community college.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) The Board of Regents shall approve the course level designations for all courses included in the statewide numbering system.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(3) The statewide course numbering system shall include the courses at the approved levels.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>C. (1) Courses that have the same academic content and are taught by faculty with comparable credentials shall be considered equivalent courses and shall be given the same course designation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) Equivalent courses shall be guaranteed to transfer to any educational institution participating in the statewide course numbering system.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>D. (1) The Board of Regents shall provide that credits to be accepted by a receiving institution are appropriately evaluated to ensure that the faculty possess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting body of the receiving institution.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) The award of credit by receiving institutions may be limited to courses that are entered in the statewide course numbering system.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>E. The course catalog and registration process for each postsecondary education institution shall include the courses at their designated levels and statewide course number.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>F. (1) Every public and nonpublic educational institution that participates in the statewide course numbering system shall be fully accredited by the appropriate education accrediting body.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) Each educational institution that awards associate of arts or associate of science degrees approved by the council for transfer to a four-year postsecondary educational institution and each four-year postsecondary educational institution that admits graduates of such associate degree programs shall be appropriately accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools--Commission on Colleges.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>G. Regionally accredited independent colleges and universities that are members of the Louisiana Association of Independent Colleges and Universities are encouraged to participate in the statewide course numbering system.</p>
