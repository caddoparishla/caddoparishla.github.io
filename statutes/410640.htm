<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. Where sixteenth section or indemnity lands granted by Congress for public school purposes have been erroneously sold by the state or paid by the state as fees for services rendered, such deficiencies shall be properly adjusted, as provided by the Constitution of 1879 and R.S. 41:641, and the amounts so determined shall be credited to the parish school boards of the parishes in which such townships are situated in proportion to the percentage of the townships lying in each said [In subsec. A, so in enrolled bill] parishes. The amounts so credited shall be treated as loans to the state on which the state shall pay interest at the rate of four percent per annum.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. The parish school boards of parishes within which there lies a township or any portion of a township containing a sixteenth section or any portion of a sixteenth section shall be entitled to a portion of the proceeds derived from the sale of the sixteenth section or any portion thereof, including the sale of timber thereon and revenues arising from mineral leases, agricultural leases, contracts, royalties, and all other revenues arising from said sales, leases, and contracts heretofore made or which may hereafter be consummated. The proceeds and revenues thereof shall be credited to the parish school boards in which such townships are situated in proportion to the percentage of the townships lying in each parish. On the funds so credited to the respective parish school boards arising from the sources above mentioned the state shall pay interest at the rate of four percent per annum so long as said funds remain on deposit in the state treasury. However, any school board shall have authority to direct by resolution that the state treasurer shall return any funds on deposit to its credit in the state treasury or which may accrue to its credit from such sixteenth sections, and said parish school boards shall have the right to use the said funds in the acquisition, construction, and equipping of public school buildings and other school facilities.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;C. The parish school boards of parishes within which there lies a township or any portion of a township containing a sixteenth section or any portion of a sixteenth section shall have the authority to lease, contract, or both, with any other governmental agency or department for the use of sixteenth section lands within the boundaries of their respective parishes. The proceeds and revenues thereof shall be credited to the parish school boards in which such townships are situated in proportion to the percentage of the sixteenth section lands lying in each parish.</p>
