(1) All such employees, as defined in R.S. 17:1205, shall be entitled to and shall be allowed a minimum of ten days leave of absence as sick leave or in case of other emergencies, per school year, without loss of pay. Any portion of such sick leave not used in any year shall be accumulated to the credit of the employee without limitation. When such employee is absent for six or more consecutive days because of personal illness, he shall be required to present a certificate from a physician, physician assistant providing health care services in accordance with R.S. 37:1360.28, or nurse practitioner providing health care services in accordance with R.S. 37:913 certifying such illness. Each parish and city school board may adopt such rules and regulations as are necessary relative to the use of such sick leave, either current or accumulated, for emergencies. The parish and city school boards may grant additional sick leave, without loss of pay, or with such reduction of pay as they may establish and fix.&#160;</font></span></p>

In the case of an employee who begins work in the first month of a school year, ten days shall be allowed; in the case of an employee who begins work in the second month of a school year, nine days shall be allowed; in the case of an employee who begins work in the third month of a school year, eight days shall be allowed; in the case of an employee who begins work in the fourth month of a school year, seven days shall be allowed; in the case of an employee who begins work in the fifth month of a school year, six days shall be allowed; in the case of an employee who begins work in the sixth month of a school year, five days shall be allowed; in the case of an employee who begins work in the seventh month of a school year, four days shall be allowed; and, in the case of an employee who begins work in the eighth month or thereafter of a school year, three days shall be allowed.&#160;</font></span></p>

(1) All sick leave accumulated by such employees pursuant to the provisions of this Subsection shall be vested in the employee by whom such leave has been accumulated. In the event of the transfer of such employee from one city or parish public school system to another in this state or upon the return of such employee to the same school system within five years or such longer period of time as may be approved by the governing authority of the school system to which the employee returned, regardless of the dates on which the leave was accumulated or the date of the transfer or return of the employee, such vested leave shall be transferred or returned to or continued by the school system to which he transfers or returns and shall be retained to the credit of such employee. When any such employee uses accrued sick leave which has been transferred from one public school system to another, the sick leave used shall be assessed against the most recent sick leave earned and accrued and successively from sick leave accrued last to sick leave accrued first.&#160;</font></span></p>
