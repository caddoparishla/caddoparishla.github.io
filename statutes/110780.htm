<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; text-autospace: none;">A. Once each year during the first five years following any retirement of a member on a disability retirement allowance and once in every three-year period thereafter, the board of trustees shall require any disability retiree whose first employment making him eligible for membership in one of the state systems occurred on or before June 30, 2015, who has not yet attained the age of sixty years and any disability retiree whose first employment making him eligible for membership in one of the state systems occurred on or after July 1, 2015, who has not yet attained the age of sixty-two to undergo a medical examination at the retiree’s expense, to be made at the place of residence of the retiree or other place mutually agreed upon, by a physician or physicians designated by the board of trustees. The periodic reexaminations may be discontinued upon advice of the medical board that the retiree’s condition is either terminal or that chances of recovery are highly improbable. If any such disability retiree refuses to submit to at least one medical examination in any such year by a physician or physicians designated by the board of trustees, his allowance may be discontinued until his withdrawal of such refusal; but if his refusal continues for one year, all of his rights in and to his pension may be revoked by the board of trustees.</p>

Every disability retiree except a disability retiree who had no earnings and is determined by the Teachers’ Retirement System of Louisiana to be incapacitated or who is residing in a nursing home shall submit to the board of trustees by May first of every year, a notarized annual earnings statement detailing his earned income from employment in the previous tax year. Should a retiree refuse to submit such an earnings statement by May first, his allowance may be discontinued without retroactive reimbursement, until the statement is filed. Should his refusal continue for the remainder of the calendar year, all his rights in and to his disability pension may be revoked by the board of trustees.</font></span></p>

(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of <span style="color: #000000; text-underline: none; text-decoration: none;"><font color="black">R.S. 11:221</font></span>, if the medical board reports and certifies to the board of trustees that a disability retiree is able to engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between his retirement allowance and the average final compensation, and if the board of trustees concurs in this report, then, except as provided in either Paragraph (2) or (3) of this Subsection, the amount of his pension shall be reduced to an amount which, together with his annuity and the amount earnable by him, shall equal the amount of his average final compensation. If his earning capacity is later changed, the amount of his pension may be further modified; however, the new pension shall not exceed the amount of the pension originally granted nor an amount which, when added to the amount earnable by the retiree together with his annuity, equals the amount of his average final compensation.</font></span></p>
