<p class="Title">HOMELESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board recognizes that homelessness alone should not be sufficient reason to separate students from the mainstream school environment. &#160;Therefore, the School Board, in accordance with state and federal law, shall give special attention to ensure that homeless children in the school district have access to a free and appropriate public education and ensure that there are no barriers to the enrollment, transportation, attendance and success in school of homeless children and youth.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DEFINITION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Homeless <i>children and youths</i> means individuals who lack a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence and include the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p>Children and youth who are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship or a similar reason; are living in motels, hotels, trailer parks or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations; are living in emergency or transitional shelters; are abandoned in hospitals.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children and youth who have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designated for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children and youth who are living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations or similar settings.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Migratory children who meet one of the above-described circumstances are also recognized under this definition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ENROLLMENT/PLACEMENT</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The best interest of the child, with parental involvement, shall be considered in determining whether the child should be enrolled in the school of origin or the school that non-homeless students who live in the attendance area in which the homeless child or youth is actually living are eligible to attend. &#160;To the extent feasible, and in accordance with the child or youth's best interest, the child or youth should continue his or her education in the school of origin. &#160;If the youth is unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, the homeless coordinator shall consider the views of the youth in deciding where the youth shall be educated. &#160;The choice regarding placement shall be made regardless of whether the child or youth lives with the homeless parents or has been temporarily placed elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The school selected shall immediately enroll the homeless child or youth, even if the child or youth is unable to produce records normally required for enrollment, such as previous academic records, immunization records, proof of residency or other documentation.&#160;&#160;However, the school district may require a parent or guardian of a homeless child or youth to submit contact information, such as medical emergency information, contact information regarding the parent, guardian, or caregiver.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The school district shall provide a written explanation, including a statement regarding the right of appeal, to the homeless child or youth's parent or guardian, or to the homeless youth if unaccompanied, if the school district sends the child or youth to a school other than the school of origin or other than a school requested by the parent or guardian.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If a dispute arises over school selection or enrollment in a school, the child, youth, parent or guardian shall be referred to the school district homeless coordinator, who will carry out the dispute resolution process as expeditiously as possible.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For the purposes of this policy, <i>school of origin</i> is defined as the school that the student attended when permanently housed or the school in which the student was last enrolled.&#160;&#160;When a child or youth completes the final grade level served by the school of origin, the school of origin includes the designated receiving school at the next grade level for all feeder schools.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SERVICES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each homeless child or youth shall be provided services comparable to services offered to other students in the school district including, but not limited to, transportation services; educational services for which the child meets the eligibility criteria, such as educational programs for disadvantaged students, students with disabilities and gifted and talented students; vocational programs and technical education; school nutrition programs; preschool programs; before- and after-school care programs; and programs for students with limited English proficiency.&#160;&#160;Homeless students shall not be segregated in a separate school or in a separate program within a school based on the students' status as homeless.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>TRANSPORTATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In the event that it is in the best interest of the homeless child or youth to attend the school of origin, transportation to and from that school shall be provided at the request of the parent, guardian or McKinney Vento Department in the case of an unaccompanied youth, the homeless coordinator/liaison.&#160;&#160;If the student begins living in an area served by another School Board, both School Boards shall agree on a method to apportion the responsibility and costs for transporting the child to and from the school of origin. &#160;If an agreement cannot be reached, the costs will be shared equally.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>RECORDS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any records ordinarily kept by the school, including immunization records, academic records, birth certificates, guardianship records and evaluations for special services or programs of each homeless child or youth shall be maintained so that appropriate services may be given the student, so that necessary referrals can be made, and so that records may be transferred in a timely fashion when a homeless child or youth enters a new school district.&#160;&#160;Copies of records shall be made available upon request to students or parents in accordance with the <i><a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title20-section1232g&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</a></i> and School Board policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ENROLLMENT DISPUTES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If a dispute arises over school selection or enrollment in a school:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise provided for in any desegregation order, the child or youth shall be immediately admitted to the school in which enrollment is sought, pending resolution of the dispute;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parent or guardian of the child or youth shall be provided with a written explanation of the school’s decision regarding school selection or enrollment, including the rights of the parent, guardian, or youth to appeal the decision;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The child, youth, parent, or guardian shall be referred to the School Board’s homeless coordinator/liaison, who shall carry out the dispute resolution process as expeditiously as possible after receiving notice of the dispute; and<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of an unaccompanied youth, the homeless coordinator/liaison shall ensure that the youth is immediately enrolled in school pending resolution of the dispute.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>LIAISON</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>One individual shall be appointed by the School Board to act as the school district's homeless liaison. &#160;The School Board shall inform school personnel, service providers and advocates working with homeless families of the duties of the school district homeless liaison.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DISCIPLINE – NOT REQUIRED TO ENROLL</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Nothing in this policy shall require the enrollment of any child not permitted by another school system to attend school, either permanently or temporarily, as a result of disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
