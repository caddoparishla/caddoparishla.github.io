<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(6) The failure of the license holder to comply with the provisions of this Chapter or any written rule or regulation of the commission.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(7) The use by an employee, solicitor or representative of the school, with the knowledge of the owner, of fraud or misrepresentation in procuring the enrollment of a student, or if any such incident is called to the attention of the owner failure by the owner to take remedial steps, including restitution of fees collected and expenses incurred by the prospective student.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(8) Failure on the part of the school to comply with each and every contract and agreement made and entered into by it or by its representative with any student.</p>

<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(11) The filing of false information with the commission, the commissioner of higher education, or the Board of Regents by an owner of a school or by any holder of a license or a permit.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(12) The failure of the owner of the school to notify the commission in writing of the withdrawal of accreditation or approval, as required in R.S. 17:3141.4(D)</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(13) Failure to provide facilities or equipment for offering courses of instruction in a safe and sanitary condition.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;E. After a hearing before the commission, a recommendation shall be made to the board for a final decision on the revocation of the license.</p>
