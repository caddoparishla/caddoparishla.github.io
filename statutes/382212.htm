Either the public entity or the design professional may choose the method and service of plan distribution.

At its sole discretion, the public entity may authorize its design professional of record to choose an electronic bid submittal system. The public entity or its design professional of record shall maintain a list of all prime bidders for the purpose of addenda distribution.&#160;</font></span></p>
