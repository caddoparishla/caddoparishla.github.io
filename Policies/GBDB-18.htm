Ann. §<a id="id3" href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/111006.htm');return false;" name="id3">11:1006</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>OTHER NON-CERTIFIED EMPLOYEES</u></p>
