<p class="Title">PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Caddo Parish School Board to conduct all meetings in full view of and with welcomed participation by the public.&#160;&#160;However, the School Board reserves the right to recess into or call executive sessions for discussing matters as provided by state law.&#160;&#160;During executive sessions, no action shall be taken or resolutions made.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>REQUEST FOR ITEM TO BE PLACED ON AGENDA</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All delegations or individuals who wish to appear before the School Board and place an item on the agenda shall submit their written requests to the Superintendent at least five (5) calendar days prior to the Executive Committee meeting date, stating what matters they wish to take up with the School Board and the approximate time such matters should consume at the meeting. &#160;Such items shall normally be included on the agenda of the meeting at which the delegation or individual wishes to appear before the School Board, following a determination by the School Board President, in consultation with the Superintendent.&#160;&#160;If not submitted on time to be placed on the agenda, the item shall be held over for the next scheduled meeting of the Executive Committee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PUBLIC COMMENTS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Citizens who wish to speak before the Caddo Parish School Board during the <i>Visitors</i> section of the agenda and before votes on specific agenda items are taken shall notify the School Board President by signing up on forms available in the Caddo Parish School Board meeting room prior to the meeting.&#160;&#160;During the <i>Visitors</i> section, visitors may speak on any topic. &#160;If a designated group is speaking (for example: Caddo Citizens for Education), only two (2) representatives may speak for three (3) minutes each or one representative for five (5) minutes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At any time when a citizen addresses the School Board, it shall require that the speaker give his/her name and address.&#160;&#160;Derogatory statements about, or directed at, a School Board member, any employee, or any other person shall not be permitted.&#160;&#160;Speakers who wish to make such comments shall be directed to submit their complaints by signed written statement.&#160;&#160;Written complaints shall be referred to the President of the School Board, the Superintendent, or to an appropriate designee for further action.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board, or Superintendent and his/her staff shall not, as a rule, answer questions from the public.&#160;&#160;The questioner’s name, address and telephone number may be taken for later personal reply.&#160;&#160;However, previously stated School Board policies or administrative regulations and procedures may be explained.&#160;&#160;A School Board member may, with the School Board President’s permission, ask a question of the speaker.&#160;&#160;When the School Board President deems it appropriate and if desired by the speaker, the School Board President may ask the Superintendent or his designee to confer with the speaker.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Public Comment on Agenda Items</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A public comment period shall be held before any vote is taken on an agenda item.&#160;&#160;Comments from the public shall occur after introduction of the item to be voted on and before any discussion by School Board members.&#160;&#160;However, a person is not entitled to take up business before the School Board unless the item in which he/she is interested has been placed on the agenda of that meeting, except during the <i>Visitors</i> section of the agenda.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>As the School Board reaches each item on its agenda, the School Board President shall recognize those persons who have indicated a desire to speak on that item.&#160;&#160;No individual may speak without first being recognized by the presiding officer.&#160;&#160;Each person may speak for not more than three (3) minutes on each item, and may speak only once on each agenda item.&#160;&#160;The individual shall limit his/her comments to matters that are strictly relevant to that agenda item.&#160;&#160;The individual shall refrain from asking questions or making requests of the School Board or staff.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall delay its deliberations on each agenda item until all members of the public who wish to address the School Board have been given an opportunity to speak.&#160;&#160;The School Board may request that a designated group speaking on an agenda item limit comments to only two (2) speakers.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In the event that the School Board should add an item to its agenda after the School Board meeting begins, or the School Board desires to consider an item upon which a vote is to be taken where no vote was originally anticipated, the School Board President shall orally request of the audience whether anyone in attendance would like to speak on the added agenda item.&#160;&#160;Each person indicating a desire to do so shall be given an opportunity to address the School Board on each agenda item added.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall delay deliberations on that agenda item until such time as all interested members of the public have had an opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of all public input on each agenda item, the School Board shall deliberate the matter and take such action as it considers appropriate.&#160;&#160;There shall be no further public input allowed on each agenda item after the School Board has begun its deliberation of that item.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Copies of this procedure shall be available for distribution to the public during regular business hours and at meetings of the School Board and its committees.</p>
