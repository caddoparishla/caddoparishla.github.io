<p class="Title">SCHOOL BUS SCHEDULING AND ROUTING</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board shall provide school bus transportation for all students living more than one mile from the school that they are assigned to attend.&#160;&#160;Students living within one mile of the school may be allowed to ride a school bus when the School Board determines that conditions exist to warrant such transportation.&#160;&#160;Other students may be provided with school bus transportation in accordance with regulations of the Louisiana Department of Education.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A reasonable time shall be established for each route and the bus operator shall be expected to adhere to this schedule.&#160;&#160;By the same token, students shall be expected to be at their respective bus stop when the bus arrives.&#160;&#160;Once a bus route has been established, the bus operator shall not alter or change assigned routes without order of the Superintendent or his/her designee.&#160;&#160;Any bus operator who feels a road is unsafe or dangerous shall report such dangerous condition to the Superintendent or his/her designee, and the bus operator may be allowed not to travel the road with the prior approval of the Transportation Director, until the Superintendent or his/her designee determines said road is safe or improved, or the situation has been rectified.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Buses must be routed so that no more than one bus will travel the same route, except in cases of definite apparent necessity.&#160;&#160;Each scheduled route shall be planned in full consideration of the established limits for individual schools.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>During inclement weather, bus operators may make more frequent stops.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>TRANSPORTATION OF STUDENTS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER SCHOOL</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It shall be the policy of the School Board to provide transportation for majority to minority transfer students to the school nearest their residence to which the majority to minority transfer would apply.&#160;&#160;Transportation shall be provided from the designated pickup point to the student’s residence.&#160;&#160;Students granted permission for a majority to minority transfer to a school other than the school nearest their residence to which the majority to minority transfer would apply shall not be provided transportation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students attending magnet schools shall be picked up from a point near their residence whenever possible; however, if it is not possible because of distance, routing, or other good causes, the parent shall be responsible for transporting the student to the designated pickup point which is closest to the student’s residence.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students granted permission to attend a <i>School Away from School</i> shall be eligible for transportation.&#160;&#160;Parents shall be responsible for transporting the students to the designated pickup point which is closest to the student’s residence.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>LOADING AND UNLOADING OF STUDENTS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Caddo Parish School Board to authorize the loading or unloading of students in accordance with the requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a id="id1" href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/170158.htm');return false;" name="id1">17:158</a> as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Prohibit a bus operator from loading or unloading students at school while the bus is in a traffic lane of any type of street as defined in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a id="id2" href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/320001.htm');return false;" name="id2">32:1</a> and require that students be loaded or unloaded on a shoulder, in a school parking lot, or at other appropriate off-road location at the school as determined by the school governing authority. The requirements of this Paragraph shall not apply if the shoulder of a municipal road is the only available alternative and the municipality has not made the shoulder available by designating that area for loading and unloading students during designated school zone hours.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prohibit a bus operator from loading or unloading students with the bus on the shoulders in Caddo Parish due to the School Board’s finding based on information submitted by its Transportation Director that to require that students be loaded or unloaded from a school bus on the shoulder of Caddo Parish roadways will be less safe for the students of Caddo Parish due to the following factors:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<div style="list-style: upper-alpha; margin-left: 2em">
<ol start="1" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p>On two lane roads, it is safer to stop and pick up students from the right lane rather than with the bus on the shoulder because the bus blocks one lane of traffic and the student only has to cross the other lane.&#160;&#160;If the bus stops on the shoulder of the road, then the student has to cross two (2) lanes of traffic.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Driving a bus onto the shoulder necessitates merging back into the traffic lane which poses unnecessary danger.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bus on the shoulder can lead other operators to believe the bus is out of service and make compliance with the bus signals less reliable.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In many circumstances, when shoulders are present, that is the area where students stand waiting for the bus.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally shoulders are not engineered for heavy vehicle traffic, as they are made of gravel or dirt; and<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When buses are on the shoulder, vehicles in the traffic lanes are less likely to realize that they are obligated to obey the bus traffic signals, compared to the more common circumstance where the bus is in a traffic lane with its signals activated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Therefore it is the policy of Caddo Parish School Board to allow students to be unloaded as follows:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<div style="list-style: upper-alpha; margin-left: 2em">
<ol start="1" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p>A bus operator may load and unload a student while the bus is in a lane of traffic but only if the bus is in the lane farthest to the right side of the road so that there is not a lane of traffic between the bus and the right-side curb or other edge of the road.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prohibit a bus operator from loading or unloading a student in a location on a divided highway such that a student, in order to walk between the bus and his home or school, would be required to cross a roadway of the highway on which traffic is not controlled by the visual signals on the school bus.</p>
</li>
</ol>
