<p class="Title">INVESTIGATIONS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>GENERAL INVESTIGATIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Concerns about serious situations or conditions within the Caddo Parish School System shall be reported to the Superintendent or his/her designee.&#160;&#160;Should the Superintendent determine that the situation warrants investigation, he/she shall have the matter investigated by appointing appropriate staff personnel (one or more persons) to make the necessary inquiries. &#160;At the conclusion of their investigation, a report shall be prepared for submission to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any investigation undertaken in the school system shall be conducted in accordance with the following stipulations:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>No School Board member shall participate in any manner in an investigation.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Superintendent shall use every means possible to protect School Board personnel from unwarranted personal criticism.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In any investigation into incidents involving accidents or injuries to students or employees, or involving student misconduct, or the competence, honesty or performance of duties of employees, all employees of the Caddo Parish School Board shall, upon reasonable request by the Superintendent or his/her designee, give a statement of the facts and circumstances within the employee's knowledge, or an accounting of the employee's conduct concerning the circumstances which are the subject of the investigation or are related to the matter being investigated.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If deemed appropriate by the Superintendent or his/her designee in the conduct of such investigation, employees, upon reasonable notification, shall appear at the offices of the Superintendent or at such other suitable location within the parish as might be appropriate and convenient in the investigation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>During any such employee interview, the employee may have representation if desired by the employee, but said representation shall be at no cost to the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board, in accordance with state law, shall initiate an investigation of an employee, in cases where the School Board has made a public announcement that an employee may be disciplined, whether or not there is an accompanying reduction in pay.&#160;&#160;The investigation shall proceed as outlined below under Reporting Procedures.&#160;&#160;Not later than thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the investigation and prior to any School Board action to implement such disciplinary action, the employee may appear, if he/she so determines, before the School Board in open session and be given a reasonable time, as determined by the School Board, to comment on the investigation and any actions taken or proposed to be taken involving the employee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>These provisions shall not be applicable to any reduction of personnel initiated by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>

<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
