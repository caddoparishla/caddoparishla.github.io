<p class="PdfParaStyle01">CHAPTER 7. FIRE PREVENTION OR PROTECTION</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle01">PART III. STATE FIRE MARSHAL</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle01">SUBPART A. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle03">&#160;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle04" style="margin-left: 84px; text-indent: -84px;">40:1578.6 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;National Fire Protection Association's Life Safety Code; Southern Standard Building Code; applicability to high rise structures; minimum standards; existing hazardous buildings; appeal</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">A. Adequate protection for life safety shall be afforded in every structure or movable as those terms are defined in R.S. 40:1573. To afford such protection, all newly constructed structures and movables shall comply with the rules and regulations to be promulgated by the fire marshal in conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act [FN1] which shall establish as minimum standards the provisions of the Life Safety Code of the National Fire Protection Association, and Section 518--Special Provisions for High Rise, of Chapter IV of the Southern Standard Building Code, applicable to high rise structures as both are annually or periodically amended, and the fire marshal shall be the authority having jurisdiction to enforce compliance with such regulations. The effective date for enforcement shall be one hundred eighty days after adoption and promulgation under the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">B. A parish or municipality which, prior to January 1, 1975, had adopted and is enforcing a nationally recognized model building code and/or fire prevention code or a code equal to a nationally recognized building code and/or fire prevention code may continue to enforce such codes in place of the codes required in the paragraph above; however, such codes shall contain requirements that are substantially equal to the fire marshal's code with respect to high rise buildings, mandatory automatic sprinkler and extinguishment systems, and fire detection systems.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">C. This Section shall not apply to existing buildings, except as provided for by R.S. 40:1641 et seq., which were lawfully constructed and maintained unless the fire marshal deems that a serious life hazard exists due to a particular condition, at which time he can require the institution of proper fire protection measures to alleviate the particular hazards noted according to the chapter on existing buildings of the latest edition of the N.F.P.A. Life Safety Code, as most recently adopted by administrative rule by the office of the state fire marshal, code enforcement and building safety. Such directives of the fire marshal may be appealed to the board of review. "Lawfully constructed and maintained" as used in this Subsection means in conformance with the laws, codes, rules, and regulations in force at the time of original construction.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle08">Added by Acts 1974, No. 656, s 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1975. Amended by Acts 1979, No. 495, s 2, eff. July 13, 1979; Acts 1985, No. 987, s 1; Acts 1988, No. 422, s 1; Acts 1995, No. 353, s 1; Acts 1997, No. 343, s 1.</p>
