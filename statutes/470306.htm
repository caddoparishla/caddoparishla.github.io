For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of tax payable, all dealers shall transmit, on or before the twentieth day of the month following the month in which this tax becomes effective, to the secretary of revenue, upon forms prescribed, prepared, and furnished by him, returns showing the gross sales, purchases, gross proceeds from lease or rental, gross payments for lease or rental, gross proceeds derived from sales of services, or gross payments for services, as the case may be, arising from all taxable transactions during the preceding calendar month. Thereafter, like returns shall be prepared and transmitted to the secretary by all dealers on or before the twentieth day of each month for the preceding calendar month. These returns shall show any further information the secretary may require to enable him to correctly compute and collect the tax levied.

The secretary shall provide by regulation for the period and method of determining, under this proviso, the average taxes due from a dealer. Any dealer who is required to file his sales tax return on a quarterly basis, as provided above, may file his returns and pay the tax on a monthly basis after first having received written approval from the secretary to do so. Application to file monthly must be furnished to the secretary in writing and will set forth complete justification for the shorter reporting period.&#160;</font></span></p>
