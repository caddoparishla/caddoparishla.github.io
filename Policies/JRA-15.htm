<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>RIGHT TO AN ACCOUNTING OF DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A parent has the right to receive an accounting of disclosures of his/her child’s protected health information made to individuals or entities other than to him/her, except for disclosures to carry out treatment, payment and health care operations as provided above; to persons involved in his/her child’s care or for other notification purposes as provided by law; for national security or intelligence purposes as provided by law; to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials as provided by law; or that occurred prior to April 13, 2003. &#160;This right applies to disclosures made during the time period of up to six &#160;(6) years from the date of the request to request an accounting of disclosures, a parent must submit a written request to Superintendent/designee, at the Caddo Parish School Board, 1961 Midway, Shreveport, LA 71108. &#160;The request must state a time period, which may not exceed six (6) years. &#160;There is no charge for the first request for accounting within a twelve-month period; however, a fee may be charged for the administrative costs of retrieving, copying, mailing, and any other activities associated with any additional requests for accounting. &#160;The parent will be notified of the costs involved and will have the option to withdraw the request at that time, before any costs are incurred.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS CONCERNING MEDICAL MATTERS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>RIGHT TO PROVIDE AN AUTHORIZATION FOR OTHER USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION</u></p>
