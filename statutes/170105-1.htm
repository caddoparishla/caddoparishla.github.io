<p class="PdfParaStyle04" style="text-indent: -78px; margin-left: 78px;">17:105.1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Transfer to schools in an adjoining school system; conditions; exceptions; funding</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">A. A pupil assigned to attend a public school which is located at a distance from the pupil's home such that the time required to transport the pupil to the assigned school from the pupil's home using the transportation provided by the school system is not less than one hour may transfer to, enroll in, and attend a public school in a school system which adjoins his own upon written application therefor to the superintendent of the adjoining system provided the superintendent of the adjoining school system agrees to accept such pupil for enrollment in a school in the adjoining school system.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">B. (1) For such a transfer to occur, the time required for the transport of a pupil from his home to the assigned school shall be documented to the satisfaction of the superintendent of the adjoining school system.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(2) The documentation of the time required for the transport of the pupil shall be presented to the superintendent of the school system providing the transportation. The superintendent may dispute the accuracy of the documentation by requesting in writing, within ten days of receipt of the documentation, a hearing on the question of the amount of time required for the transport of the student before the school board of the adjoining school system. In such a case, a hearing shall be held within thirty days of receipt of the written request. The finding of the school board of the adjoining school system shall be final as to the question.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">C. In addition to all other requirements in this Section, for such a student transfer to occur, the adjoining school system shall provide transportation for the pupil. The time required to transport the pupil from his home to the school in the adjoining system to which he is assigned shall be less than one hour.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">D. In the case of the transfer of any student pursuant to this Section, the adjoining school system shall notify the state Department of Education. The state Department of Education shall adjust the allocation of money through the Minimum Foundation Program formula or any other monies appropriated and allocated among school systems based in any way on the number of students enrolled so as to account for the transfer of the student.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">E. The authority to enroll in an adjoining school system as provided in this Section shall not be permitted and may not be exercised if doing so violates the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, whether the court is a state court or a federal court.</p>
