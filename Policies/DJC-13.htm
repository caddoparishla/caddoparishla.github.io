<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Title">PAYROLL PROCEDURES</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Salaries for all personnel shall be paid according to the salary schedule established by and approved by the Caddo Parish School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PAYDAY SCHEDULES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The salaries of all employees shall be distributed over twelve (12) months, regardless of employment period.&#160;&#160;The pay period for regular employees shall be the first working day of each calendar month to the last day of the calendar month.&#160;&#160;If a pay day falls on or during a school holiday or weekend, employees shall receive their pay on the last work day preceding the holiday or weekend. &#160;Employees who join the school system during the school year shall have their salaries pro-rated accordingly.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All employees will be paid semi-monthly on the 15th and the last day of the month.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All payroll changes concerning salary deductions for federal taxes, local taxes, group insurance and other miscellaneous payroll deductions must be received by the payroll accounting department at least ten (10) working days prior to the last working day of the month.&#160;&#160;Otherwise, such changes shall not be effective until the following month.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Changes in taxes or payroll deductions must be on the appropriate form and received by the payroll department to change the amount being deducted.&#160;&#160;Cancellations in payroll deductions shall only be by written notification from the employee.&#160;&#160;Changes sent directly to insurance companies shall not be effective until the change notification is received by the payroll department.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>No check shall be written for any regular or substitute employee until the personnel department receives the minimum information of:&#160;&#160;name, address, and social security number.&#160;&#160;If no W-4 form is received for federal and local taxes, the taxes to be withheld shall be at the single rate with no dependents.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Checks for Other than Salary</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Stipends, summer school pay, overtime, travel reimbursements, and any other pay outside of normal salaries shall be paid as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the time sheet, or substitute form, or other documentation, with appropriate signatures, is received by the business office in accordance with the annually published business office calendar, then a remuneration check shall be issued on the 15th of the month unless the 15th falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday. &#160;If a pay day falls on or during a school holiday or weekend, employees shall receive their checks on the workday preceding the holiday or weekend.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Any other payments not submitted by the prescribed reporting date shall be processed with the next pay period.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Lost Checks/Incorrect Deposit Instructions</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If a check was lost as a result of the employee failing to notify the central office of a change of address or other employee negligence, or lost by a postal system, the employee shall receive a replacement check on the next scheduled payroll date.&#160;&#160;If there was an administrative error or a payroll check comes back with an error, the employee shall receive a replacement check as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>TEACHERS SEPARATING</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Teachers separating from the Caddo Parish School Board at the close of the school session may request in writing that they receive full payment for their services.&#160;&#160;Otherwise, they shall continue to receive their payment on a monthly basis during June, July, and August.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Teachers separating from the school system during the school year shall receive payment in full for their services on or before the next regular payday or no later than fifteen (15) days following the date of termination, whichever occurs first.</p>
