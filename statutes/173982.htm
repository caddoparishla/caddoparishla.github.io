(1)(a)(i) Local school boards shall comply with R.S. 17:3983 and shall review and formally act upon each charter proposal received within time lines established by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education that are consistent with national best practices in charter school authorizing. Such time lines shall require, at a minimum, an annual charter application process in which local school boards are afforded at least ninety days to evaluate such applications. In conducting such review, the local school board shall determine whether each proposed charter complies with the law and rules, whether the proposal is valid, complete, financially well-structured, and educationally sound, whether it provides for a master plan for improving behavior and discipline in accordance with R.S. 17:252, whether it provides a plan for collecting data in accordance with R.S. 17:3911, and whether it offers potential for fulfilling the purposes of this Chapter. The local board shall engage in a transparent application review process that complies with the latest Principles and Standards for Quality Charter School Authorizing, as promulgated by the National Association of Charter School Authorizers, and shall provide for an independent evaluation of the charter proposal by a third party with educational, organizational, legal, and financial expertise. The local board shall send to the charter applicant, either by electronic means or hand delivery, the final evaluation and recommendations, if any, of the third-party evaluator. Such information shall be sent no later than five business days prior to the meeting at which the local board will take action on the charter proposal. Each local board shall use a common charter application developed by the state Department of Education and approved by the state board, but may request additional information from applicants as needed.&#160;</font></span></p>
