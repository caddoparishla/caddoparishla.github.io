<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(3) Upon the filing of the certificate and affidavit by the secretary of state, the cooperative shall cease to carry on its business except in so far as may be necessary for winding up thereof, but its corporate existence shall continue until articles of dissolution have been filed by the secretary of state;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(4) After filing of the certificate and affidavit by the secretary of state the board of directors shall immediately cause notice of the liquidation proceedings to be mailed to each known creditor and claimant and to be published once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the parish in which the principal office of the cooperative is located;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(5) The board of directors shall have full power to liquidate and settle the affairs of the cooperative and shall proceed to collect the debts owing to the cooperative, convey and dispose of its property and assets, pay, satisfy, and discharge its debts, obligations and liabilities, and do all other things required to liquidate its business and affairs, and after paying or adequately providing for the payment of all its debts, obligations and liabilities, shall distribute the remainder of its property and assets among its members;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(6) When all debts, liabilities and obligations of the cooperative have been paid and discharged or adequate provision shall have been made therefor, and all of the remaining property and assets of the cooperative shall have been distributed pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the board of directors shall authorize the execution of articles of dissolution which shall thereupon be executed and acknowledged on behalf of the cooperative by its president or vice-president, and its corporate seal shall be affixed thereto and attested by its secretary.

<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(c) That the cooperative has heretofore delivered to the secretary of state a certificate of election to dissolve and the date on which the certificate was filed by the secretary of state in the records of his office;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(d) That all debts, obligations and liabilities of the cooperative have been paid and discharged or that adequate provisions have been made therefor;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(e) That all the remaining property and assets of the cooperative have been distributed among the members in accordance with the provisions of this Section; and</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(f) That there are no actions or suits pending against the cooperative.</p>
