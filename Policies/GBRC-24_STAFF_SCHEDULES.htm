<p class="Title">STAFF SCHEDULES</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DAILY WORK SCHEDULES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board shall require all personnel to follow the school calendar and holiday schedule during the school term.&#160;&#160;The Superintendent, with approval from the Caddo Parish School Board, shall establish office hours and work schedules outside the normal school calendar as necessary.&#160;&#160;Normal business hours shall be officially designated as 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, for the central office.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The business hours for each school shall vary from school to school.&#160;&#160;Principals and the administrative staff should be in their buildings ahead of students or teachers, and should remain in their buildings until students and teachers have gone from school.&#160;&#160;Principals who leave their buildings for any purpose, other than attendance at civic clubs, principals' meetings, going to the administrative offices of the School Board, or other routine business affairs connected with the schools, shall notify their respective School Directors in advance of anticipated absences.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Teachers are expected to be at school at least fifteen (15) minutes before school starts and may leave school no sooner than fifteen (15) minutes after the close of school each day. &#160;Exceptions to this time schedule may be made by the principal/building administrator when, in his/her opinion, a justifiable request has been made in advance by the teacher. <i>School day</i> shall mean the regular student attendance hours, whether or not students are actually present.&#160;&#160;The designated school day shall be submitted to the School Director and coordinated with transportation prior to the start of the school term.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Principals and department heads shall be authorized to adjust staff personnel schedules during the work week in order to prevent any employee incurring overtime work, unless properly authorized.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Planning Time</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Time schedules for teachers shall include daily planning time. &#160;Teachers shall be expected to stay longer on duty days, other necessary school-related activities and for parent-teacher conferences. &#160;If an administrator or counselor initiates a parent/teacher conference, 24 hour notice must be provided to the teacher. &#160;Teachers may request that an administrator or counselor attend the initiated parent-teacher conference.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Duty Free Lunch</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Teachers shall have an uninterrupted duty free lunch period daily for at least thirty (30) minutes, except when emergencies or special events make it necessary to alter the schedule.&#160;&#160;Duty-free lunch periods shall be scheduled by the principal.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SUMMER WORK SCHEDULE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent may designate and maintain a summer work schedule that varies from the normal business hours.&#160;&#160;The principal shall be responsible for the operation of the school during the summer months.&#160;&#160;This includes summer maintenance, financial statements, requisitions, request for services, reports, mail and correspondence, school records and transcripts, and the coordination of the school operation with the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The principal shall give the Superintendent a telephone number(s) where he/she may be contacted at any time.&#160;&#160;The assistant principal shall be contacted in the absence of the principal as needed.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>MODIFIED WORK SCHEDULE (MODIFIED DUTY)</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any employee recovering from a work-related disability and whose recovery is determined by a physician to be to the point where the employee can resume at least partial duties and/or hours of work, may be allowed to return to work on a modified duty schedule.&#160;&#160;Such a work schedule and/or the nature of the work to be performed by the returning employee shall be at the discretion of the Superintendent or in a school, at the discretion of the principal, subject to the approval of the Superintendent.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall endeavor to provide reasonable accommodation to such an employee based on the employee’s circumstances and conditions of employment in accordance with School Board policy <i><a href="GAAB_-_INDIVIDUALS_WITH_DISABILITIES.htm">GAAB, Individuals with Disabilities</a>.</i>&#160;&#160;A modified work schedule may continue only until the employee is certified to return to his or her normal work schedule by a physician or the employee has been determined to be permanently disabled.</p>
