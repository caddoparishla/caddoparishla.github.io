<p class="Title">STUDENT BEHAVIOR</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Caddo Parish Public School System is implementing the PBIS framework across the entire school district.&#160;&#160;<i>Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS)</i> is a proven, research and evidence-based discipline program that emphasizes school-wide systems of support that include strategies for defining, teaching, modeling and supporting appropriate student behaviors to create positive school environments.&#160;&#160;The <i>PBIS</i> framework requires that each school and teacher define and teaches core behavioral expectations, acknowledges appropriate student behavior and establishes a consistent continuum of consequences of problem behavior.&#160;&#160;The <i>Student Code of Conduct</i> compliments and supports the school district-wide implementation of <i>PBIS</i> to foster student academic and behavioral success.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In addition to their school district-wide Code, each school must develop its own PBIS plan.&#160;&#160;This plan must include activities for teaching and encouraging expected behaviors.&#160;&#160;Each school must communicate its PBIS plan to its parents/caregivers and students – including strategies for teaching and reinforcing behavior and strategies for providing consequences for both positive and negative behavior.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Academic success is directly correlated with instructional time received by the student.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In the effort to fully implement <i>Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports</i> and reduce the loss of instructional time due to out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, the Caddo Parish Public School System expects that each school, when appropriate, will utilize a wide variety of <i>corrective strategies</i> that do not remove children from valuable instructional time.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Corrective Strategies</i> may include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc; margin-top: 0in;">
<li>
<p>Contact and/or conference with parent/guardian</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavioral contracts and/or Behavior Support Plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enrollment in a <i>Check-in/Check-out (CICO)</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home/school communication system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflective activity</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><u>PHILOSOPHY OF DISCIPLINE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Every student is entitled to an education which shall be offered in an orderly, healthy atmosphere, both physical and emotional, and to firm, fair treatment in all matters pertaining to school life.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Every child shall comply with all rules and regulations of both the state and the Caddo Parish School Board having to do with student behavior.&#160;&#160;In a democracy there exist many privileges and freedoms, all of which are dependent on observance of certain rules and regulations.&#160;&#160;It should be made very clear that any student, by his own failure to comply with school regulations, may lose his right to a public education.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each teacher in Caddo Parish is responsible for providing an environment that will bring about effective learning, thus enabling each student to achieve his maximum potential.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The home shares responsibility in the education of youth, and the attitude of the home toward school is reflected by the student.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DEFINITION OF DISCIPLINE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Discipline is a standard of behavior, which is demonstrated by appropriate conduct in all situations.&#160;&#160;Any student whose behavior is not conducive to a viable learning environment shall be subjected to disciplinary action in accordance with the policies, methods, and procedures hereinafter set forth.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DEFINITION OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Disciplinary action is the method and process whereby appropriate and acceptable standards of conduct and order are maintained.&#160;&#160;It involves the acts of correcting, restricting, withholding of privileges and the administration of other penalties and punishments commensurate to the particular infraction of rules and/or regulations.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DISCIPLINE AND THE LAW</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<br /></p>
</li>
<li>

<p><u>Alternatives to Suspension or Expulsion Programs</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Since academic achievement is associated with the amount of instructional time received by the student, the utilization of alternatives to suspension or expulsion is encouraged.&#160;&#160;Alternatives which may be used include the following:&#160;&#160;communication with parents, referral for counseling services, behavioral contracts, detention centers, using a team approach, corporal punishment (elementary and middle school), in-school suspensions, the time-out room, supervised work assignments and placement in approved alternative educational programs.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PROCEDURAL POLICIES FOR DISCIPLINE CASES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Hearing by Principal</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>An informal hearing shall be conducted by the principal or designee prior to the suspension of any student unless the student’s presence in the school endangers persons or property or threatens disruption of the academic process.&#160;&#160;The principal shall be authorized to have the student immediately removed from the school.&#160;&#160;When necessary to determine responsibility for alleged misconduct, the principal or designee may suspend a student from school for a period of three (3) days pending an investigation.&#160;&#160;If the investigation determines that the student is not responsible for the misconduct, the suspension is rescinded.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The informal hearing between the principal or designee and the student shall take place immediately.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school principal or designee shall advise the student in question of the particular misconduct of which the student is accused, as well as the basis for such accusation.&#160;&#160;The student shall be given the opportunity to explain his/her version of the facts.&#160;&#160;The principal or designee will call witnesses requested by the student.&#160;&#160;Witnesses are not required to be sworn in, and the proceedings shall be conducted informally, but subject to the control and direction of the principal or designee.&#160;&#160;The principal or designee should make every reasonable effort to reach a fair determination of the issue.&#160;&#160;In the event the particular misconduct involves assault or battery upon a teacher or other school personnel, then the teacher or other personnel shall be allowed the opportunity to give information to the principal either orally or in writing.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the principal imposes a suspension of nine days or less, or a disciplinary action other than a recommendation for expulsion, no further hearing shall be required.&#160;&#160;A student must have a hearing with the Superintendent or designee if recommendation is for ten (10) days or more.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In each case of suspension or expulsion the school principal, or his/her designee, shall contact by telephone at the telephone number shown on the student’s registration card or send a certified letter at the address shown on the student’s registration card to the parent, tutor, or legal guardian of the student in question giving notice of the suspension or expulsion, the reasons therefore and establishing a date and time for a conference with the principal or his designee as a requirement for readmitting the student provided that in the case of expulsion, the contact with the parent or guardian shall include a certified letter.&#160;&#160;If the parent, tutor, or guardian fails to attend the required conference within five school days of mailing the certified letter or other contact with the parent, tutor or guardian, the truancy laws shall become effective.&#160;&#160;On not more than one occasion each school year when the parent, tutor, or legal guardian refuses to respond, the principal may determine whether readmitting the student is in the best interest of the student.&#160;&#160;On any subsequent occasions in the same year, the student shall not be readmitted unless the parent, tutor, legal guardian, court, or other appointed representative responds.&#160;&#160;A parent or guardian who willfully refuses to attend a conference, meeting or hearing regarding a student’s behavior shall be referred to a court exercising juvenile jurisdiction pursuant to the Children’s Code.&#160;&#160;A student whose presence in or about a school poses a continued danger to any person or property or an ongoing threat of disruption to the academic process shall be immediately removed from the school premises without the benefit of the procedure described hereinabove; however, the necessary procedure shall follow as soon as is practicable.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event the suspension is for damages to property owned by the school system or property contracted by the school system, the notice shall advise the parent or guardian that the student will not be readmitted until payment in full has been made for such damage or until directed by the Superintendent.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
