<p class="Title">SEARCHES OF STUDENT'S PERSON</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board authorizes any teacher, principal, school security guard, or administrator under the employ of the School Board to search a student's person or his or her personal effects when, based on the attendant circumstances at the time of the search, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the search will reveal evidence that the student has violated the law, a school rule, or a School Board policy.&#160;&#160;Searches may also be conducted to assure compliance with health, safety, and/or security laws, rules, or regulations.&#160;&#160;Such a search shall be conducted in a manner that is reasonably related to the purpose of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age or sex of the student and the nature of the suspected offense.&#160;&#160;Strip searches are specifically prohibited.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If a school administrator suspects the presence of firearms, weapons (defined as <i>dangerous instrumentalities</i>), illegal drugs, stolen goods, or other materials or objects the possession of which is a violation of School Board policy, random searches with a metal detector of students or their personal effects may be conducted at any time, provided they are conducted without deliberate touching of the student.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any search of student's person, pat-down or otherwise, shall be done privately by one of the persons above authorized and of the same sex as the student to be searched.&#160;&#160;At least one (1) witness who is a school administrator or teacher, also of the same sex as the student, shall be present during the search.&#160;&#160;Detailed documentation shall be made of all searches.&#160;&#160;Items which are specifically prohibited by law, School Board policy or school regulations shall be immediately seized.&#160;&#160;The school administrator/designee shall immediately contact the student's parent/guardian, appropriate law enforcement agency (when appropriate) and the Superintendent.&#160;&#160;The Superintendent, upon further investigation, shall notify the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Upon any such violations, the student(s) shall be automatically suspended and/or recommended for expulsion by school authorities, as appropriate.&#160;&#160;Investigative facts and/or seized items shall be immediately turned over to the proper law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whenever any search is conducted pursuant to this policy, as soon as is reasonably practical, a written record shall be made thereof by the school administrator/designee conducting the search, and such record shall include the name of the student and/or person(s) involved, the circumstances leading to the search and the results of the search.&#160;This written, dated and signed record shall be filed and maintained in the school administrator's office, and a copy of it shall be immediately sent to the Superintendent.&#160;&#160;The student and parent(s)/guardian(s) shall be given a written receipt for any items seized and/or impounded by the school administrator/designee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>CONFISCATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Upon proper school personnel confiscating any firearm, bomb, knife, or other implement which could be used as a weapon, or any controlled dangerous substance, the principal or designee shall report the confiscation to the proper law enforcement officials.&#160;&#160;Any implement or material confiscated shall be retained, cataloged, and secured by the principal so as to prevent the destruction, alteration, or disappearance until such time as the implement or material is given to law enforcement personnel for disposal.&#160;&#160;Parents shall be notified of any item impounded.&#160;&#160;Any principal or designee failing to report any prohibited weapon or confiscated material or implement to the proper law enforcement officials or failing to properly secure any weapon or confiscated material or implement shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action as may be determined by the Superintendent and/or School Board.</p>
