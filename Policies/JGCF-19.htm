<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent shall approve administrative procedures to provide for student safety and effective implementation of this policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board may establish sanctions, including termination of a provider's authorization to provide services on any school campus, against a behavioral health provider for failure to comply with the provisions of this policy and associated procedures and/or any other School Board policy and procedures.</p>
