<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Handling Evidence</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whenever an employee/administrator receives notice of a bullying or hazing, or similar behavior, any physical evidence of the act/communication shall be secured in the building administrator’s office with as little physical contact as possible.&#160;&#160;If the act/communication is in the form of graffiti, the area shall be sealed off by the building administrator.&#160;&#160;Photographs shall be taken as soon as possible.&#160;&#160;Student/public exposure shall be as minimal as possible.&#160;&#160;Graffiti shall not be removed until law enforcement has properly examined the area.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>APPEAL</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the school principal or his/her designee does not take timely and effective action in any bullying incident, the student, parent or legal guardian, or school employee may report, in writing, the incident to the School Board.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall begin an investigation of any properly reported complaint that alleges prohibited conduct the next business day during which school is in session after the report is received by the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the School Board does not take timely and effective action, the student, parent or legal guardian, or other school employee may report any bullying incident to the Louisiana Department of Education.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DISCIPLINARY ACTION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Once a report has been received at a school, and a school principal or his/her designee has determined that an act of bullying, hazing, or similar behavior has occurred, and after having met with the parent or legal guardian of the student involved, the principal or his/her designee, or applicable school official shall take prompt and appropriate disciplinary action against the student, and report criminal conduct to law enforcement.&#160;&#160;Counseling and/or other interventions may also be recommended.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students may be disciplined for off-campus bullying, hazing, or similar behavior the same as if the improper conduct occurred on campus, if the actions of the offender substantially interfere with the education opportunities or educational programs of the student victim and/or adversely affects the ability of the student victim to participate in or benefit from the school’s education programs or activities.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PARENTAL RELIEF</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If a parent, legal guardian, teacher, or other school official has made four (4) or more reports of separate instances of bullying, and no investigation pursuant to state law or this policy has occurred, the parent or legal guardian of the alleged victim may request that the student be transferred to another school operated by the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Such request shall be filed with the Superintendent.&#160;&#160;Upon receipt of the request to transfer the student to another school, the School Board shall make a seat available at another school under its jurisdiction within ten (10) school days of the parent or legal guardian's request for a transfer.&#160;&#160;If the School Board has no other school under its jurisdiction serving the grade level of the alleged victim, within fifteen (15) school days of receiving the request, the Superintendent shall:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Inform the student and his/her parent or legal guardian and facilitate the student's enrollment in a statewide virtual school.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer the student a placement in a full-time virtual program or virtual school under the School Board’s jurisdiction.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Superintendent or director of another governing authority to secure a placement and provide for the transfer of the student to a school serving the grade level of the student, in accordance with statutory provisions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If no seat or other placement is made available within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of the request by the Superintendent, the parent or legal guardian may request a hearing with the School Board, which shall be public or private at the option of the parent or legal guardian.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall grant the hearing at the next scheduled meeting or within sixty (60) calendar days, whichever is sooner.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At the end of any school year, the parent or legal guardian may make a request to the School Board to transfer the student back to the original school.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall make a seat available at the original school that the student attended.&#160;&#160;No other schools shall qualify for transfer under this provision.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>FAILURE TO ACT</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any teacher, counselor, bus operator, administrator, or other school employee, whether full- or part-time, who witnesses bullying or who receives a report of bullying from an alleged victim, and who fails to report the incident to a school official shall be investigated by the School Board. &#160;Upon finding a reasonable expectation that the individual failed to act, the School Board shall suspend the individual without pay.&#160;&#160;The length of the suspension shall be determined by the School Board based on the severity of the bullying inflicted on the victim.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall report each finding of a failure to report and the length of suspension issued to each employee who failed to report to the State Department of Education.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any school administrator or official who fails to notify a parent or legal guardian of a report of bullying, timely investigate a report of bullying, take prompt and appropriate disciplinary action against a student that was determined to have engaged in bullying, or report criminal conduct to the appropriate law enforcement official shall be investigated by the School Board.&#160;&#160;Upon finding a reasonable expectation that the individual failed to act, the School Board shall suspend the individual without pay. &#160;The length of the suspension shall be determined by the School Board based on the severity of the bullying inflicted on the victim.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall report each finding of a failure to report bullying and the length of suspension issued to the employee who failed to report to the State Department of Education. &#160;The report shall be submitted by August first annually.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>TRAINING</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall provide a minimum of four (4) hours of training for all new employees who have contact with students and two (2) hours of training each subsequent year for all school employees who have contact with students, including bus operators, with respect to bullying, in accordance with state statutory provisions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>RETALIATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Retaliation against any person who reports bullying, hazing, or similar behavior in good faith, who is thought to have reported such conduct, who files a complaint, or who otherwise participates in an investigation or inquiry concerning allegations of bullying, hazing, or similar behavior is prohibited conduct and subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>CHILD ABUSE</u></p>
