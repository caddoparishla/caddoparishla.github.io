<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">A. (1) The lawful beneficiary, assignee, or payee, including the insured's estate, of a life insurance policy or endowment policy, shall be entitled to the proceeds and avails of the policy against the creditors and representatives of the insured and of the person effecting the policy or the estate of either, and against the heirs and legatees of either person, and such proceeds and avails shall also be exempt from all liability for any debt of the beneficiary, payee, or assignee or estate, existing at the time the proceeds or avails are made available for his own use.&#160;&#160;For purposes of this Subsection, the proceeds and avails of the policy include the cash surrender value of the policy.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">(2) The exemption authorized in Paragraph (1) of this Subsection from seizure under any writ, mandate, or process issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, including any bankruptcy proceedings, shall not apply to that portion of the cash surrender value, or loan value of any life insurance policy, endowment policy, or annuity contract payable upon surrender during the lifetime of the insured or annuitant which exceeds the sum of thirty-five thousand dollars if such policy or contract was issued within nine months of issuance of such writ, mandate, or process or the filing of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding under the United States Code.&#160;&#160;However, an insurer shall be liable only for such amounts that exceed the thirty-five thousand dollar exemption which are in the insurer's possession at the time the insurer receives, at its home office, written notice by or on behalf of a creditor of claims being made against such value or interest with specification of the amount claimed.&#160;&#160;The insurer shall have no obligation to determine the validity or the accuracy of the amount of the claim and shall be relieved of further liability of any kind with respect to the monies paid upon request of a creditor.&#160;&#160;An insurer shall be entitled to be paid by preference and priority over the claim of any seizing creditor the balance of any bona fide loan to the insured or owner which is secured by such interest or value in the policy or contract.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">(b) States on its face or anywhere within the terms of the contract that it is an "annuity" including but not limited to an immediate, deferred, fixed, equity indexed, or variable annuity, irrespective of current pay status or any other definition of "annuity" in Louisiana law.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">(c) Provides the contract owner the ability to defer United States income taxes on any interest earned and not distributed to the owner.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">(e) Was approved as an annuity contract by the Department of Insurance of the state in which it was issued prior to issue.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">C. The lawful beneficiary designated in an education savings account depositor's agreement to receive account funds in the event of the account owner's death, including the account owner's estate, of the funds contained in an education savings account established pursuant to R.S. 17:3095 shall be entitled to the proceeds and avails of the education savings account against the creditors and representatives of the account owner or the person effecting the account, or the estate of either, and against the heirs and legatees of either person, except the rights of forced heirs, and the proceeds and avails shall also be exempt from all liability for any debt of the beneficiary or estate existing at the time the proceeds and avails are made available for his own use.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">(b) Whether or not the policy, contract, or education savings account depositor's agreement is made payable to the person whose life is insured, to his estate, or to the estate of an annuitant or to the estate of an education savings account owner if the beneficiary, assignee, or payee shall predecease the person.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">(2) This Subsection shall not be construed so as to defeat any policy or contract provision which provides for disposition of proceeds in the event the beneficiary, assignee, or payee shall predecease the insured, annuitant, or education savings account owner.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">E. No person shall be compelled to exercise any rights, powers, options, or privileges under any policy, contract, or education savings account depositor's agreement.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">F. There shall be excepted from the provisions of this Section a debt secured by a pledge of a policy, any rights under the policy that may have been assigned, and any advance payments made on or against the policy.</p>
