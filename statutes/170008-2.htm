<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>B. When inviting publishers to participate in the state textbook adoption process, the state Department of Education shall clearly communicate the state's desire to increase the availability and accessibility of electronic textbooks and instructional materials in the state's public elementary and secondary schools and shall encourage all publishers to provide electronic versions of the products they offer for state adoption, whether in addition to, or in lieu of, the printed version.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>D. The purchase of printed textbooks and other instructional materials by a city, parish, or other local public school board shall be made in accordance with State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education policy.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) Such purchases shall not be subject to or limited by any textbook adoption cycle established by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, and the state board shall not restrict the amount or percentage of state or local funds a city, parish, or other local public school board may expend for the purchase of electronic textbooks, instructional materials, or other education related media or content, or their means of distribution or access.</p>
