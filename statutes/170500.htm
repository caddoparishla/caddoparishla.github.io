As used in this Subpart, “clinician” means a physician, physician assistant providing healthcare services in accordance with R.S. 37:1360.28, or an advanced practice registered nurse providing healthcare services in accordance with R.S. 37:913. The parish and city school boards are authorized to adopt such rules and regulations as are necessary relative to the use of such sick leave, either current or accumulated, for emergencies or special circumstances. The parish and city school boards may grant additional sick leave, without loss of pay, or with such reduction of pay as they may establish and fix.&#160;</font></span></p>
