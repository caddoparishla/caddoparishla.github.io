<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">(2) The minimum of ten days of sick leave provided in this Subsection shall be allowed based on a teacher beginning work at the beginning of a school year.&#160;&#160;In the case of a teacher who begins work in the first month of a school year, ten days shall be allowed;&#160;&#160;in the case of a teacher who begins work in the second month of a school year, nine days shall be allowed;&#160;&#160;in the case of a teacher who begins work in the third month of a school year, eight days shall be allowed;&#160;&#160;in the case of a teacher who begins work in the fourth month of a school year, seven days shall be allowed;&#160;&#160;in the case of a teacher who begins work in the fifth month of a school year, six days shall be allowed;&#160;&#160;in the case of a teacher who begins work in the sixth month of a school year, five days shall be allowed;&#160;&#160;in the case of a teacher who begins work in the seventh month of a school year, four days shall be allowed;&#160;&#160;and, in the case of a teacher who begins work in the eighth month or thereafter of a school year, three days shall be allowed.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">(2) The sick leave authorized by this Subsection shall be in addition to all other sick leave authorized in this Section, provided that additional sick leave earned during the period of disability as a result of such assault or battery or physical contact shall not be accumulated from year to year, nor shall such additional sick leave be compensated for at death or retirement or compensated for in any other manner except as authorized in this Subsection.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">G. (1) For the purposes provided in this Subsection, all sick leave accumulated by each teacher and superintendent pursuant to the provisions of this Subpart shall be vested in the teacher or superintendent by whom such leave has been accumulated.&#160;&#160;In the event of the transfer of such teacher or superintendent from one public school system to another in this state or upon the return of such teacher or superintendent to the same school system within five years or such longer period of time as may be approved by the governing authority of the school system to which the teacher or superintendent returned, regardless of the dates on which the leave was accumulated or the date of the transfer or return of the teacher or superintendent, such vested leave shall be transferred or returned to or continued by the school system to which he transfers or returns and shall be retained to the credit of such teacher or superintendent.&#160;&#160;When any teacher or superintendent uses accrued sick leave which has been transferred from one public school system to another, the sick leave used shall be assessed against the most recent sick leave earned and accrued and successively from sick leave accrued last to sick leave accrued first.</p>
