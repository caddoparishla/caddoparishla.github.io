<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;A. Prior to the beginning of the 1985-1986 school year, the Department of Education, hereafter referred to as "the department", shall invite each public school system in the state to submit to the department a proposal for a pilot project for in-school suspension of students in the public elementary and secondary schools operated by those school systems.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;B. The department shall consider and evaluate each proposal and recommend for approval by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, hereafter referred to as the board, from among those submitted and deemed eligible pursuant to Subsection C of this Section, the maximum number of projects which can be funded by monies appropriated for this purpose. The board shall approve the projects to be funded. In making recommendations to the board for approval of projects for funding, the department shall evaluate each proposal on each of the following elements:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(1) The probable educational value. For evaluation of this element, project applicants shall submit and the department shall review the statistical history of out-of-school suspensions from the schools in which the program is proposed to be piloted for the 1985-1986 school year.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(2) The probable effectiveness of the project as an alternative to suspensions from school.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(3) The probable cost effectiveness of the use of the funds.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(4) The potential for improving the attendance of students and the education provided to students if the project were to be implemented on a statewide basis.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;C. To be eligible for selection for funding as provided in this Section, any project proposal shall contain at a minimum:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(1) A statement of the needs the project intends to address.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(2) A statement of anticipated results and the basis upon which results are expected.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(3) A specific outline of implemental steps.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(4) A detailed plan for staff usage.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(5) A detailed budget for expending the monies granted.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(6) A detailed explanation of and plan for evaluation of the project results.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;(7) A parental involvement component which requires the principal or his designee to personally contact the parents prior to in-school or out-of-school suspension or expulsion of a child unless the child presents imminent danger to the school environment. This component shall also require the principal, after contacting parents or parent, to conduct a conference with the parent, the teacher if the teacher's presence is deemed necessary by the principal, and student when a child is suspended for any of the following: fighting students or faculty, disrespect for authority, disturbance in classroom or campus, cutting class, leaving campus, excess tardiness and absence, habitual violation of school rules, profane or obscene language, smoking, threatening students, stealing, possession of weapon, possession of drugs, vandalism, possession of or shooting of fireworks, or gambling.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;D. Any school system whose pilot project is selected for funding shall receive, through the department from monies appropriated for the purpose, the funds requested in the proposal to implement the project during the 1985-1986 school year.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;E. Each school system awarded monies under this Section shall implement its project during the 1985-1986 school year. The pilot program may be implemented in no more than one school per selected school system; which school system may expend a maximum of thirty-five thousand dollars on the project. Before July 1st, 1986, the school system shall provide to the department a thorough written review of the project, including documentation of how the monies awarded under this Section were spent, the results of the project, and the recommendations of the school system with regard to the project. Each school system shall return to the department any of the money awarded pursuant to this Section that is unexpended and shall reimburse the department for any undocumented expenditure of funds received under this Section.</p>
