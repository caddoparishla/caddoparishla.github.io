<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Title">EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE AND HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAM</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board recognizes that employees may have personal problems that could affect their overall job performance.&#160;&#160;Some of these problems are excessive absences, behavior that is causing a disruption at the work site, safety violations, alcohol/drug abuse, and financial problems, all of which may contribute to the employee's poor job performance, high medical claims or even death.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In order to promote a healthy work environment and provide employees with health related issues, the School Board shall establish and maintain an <i>Employee Assistance Program</i> (EAP).&#160;&#160;The purpose of the EAP is to help employees cope with stress and other health related issues by providing discussions regarding problem-identification/ assessment, stress reducing activities, workplace consultation, crisis intervention, referral and follow-up services.&#160;&#160;The Caddo Parish School Board considers that seeking assistance and support for a myriad of health related issues should be seen as a positive approach to be encouraged and dealt with without jeopardy, and not to be viewed in any sense as an admission of weakness.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SERVICES AND CONDITIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Employee Assistance Program shall be a responsibility of the Division of Human Resources.&#160;&#160;The Employee Assistance Program shall provide health awareness and education programs designed to inform supervisors and employees about such issues as the harmful effects of alcohol and other drugs, the effects of poor job performance, and other negative conditions that are not conducive in a healthy workplace.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Training and education shall be provided to supervisors to help them identify employees whose work performance may be substandard or affected by alcohol/drug abuse or other harmful behavior.&#160;&#160;Assessments and/or evaluations of employee health issues, direct counseling of employees or referrals to other professional counseling and assessment services shall also be provided through the EAP.&#160;&#160;Assessment may include drug screening, physical and/or psychological testing and referral.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>VOLUNTARY USE OF THE EAP</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees may voluntarily use the EAP and shall not have their employment or job security jeopardized because of participation in any EAP activity, including assessment, counseling or treatment.&#160;&#160;EAP participation, however, does not preclude disciplinary action for behavior or conduct that is unacceptable or in violation of Caddo Parish School Board policy.&#160;&#160;In cases where an employee is seeking assistance for alcohol and drug abuse concerns, the provisions of policy <i><a href="GAME_-_EMPLOYEE_ALCOHOL_AND_DRUG_TESTING.htm">GAME, Employee Alcohol and Drug Testing</a></i> shall prevail. &#160;In this instance, employees should be aware of the consequences for subsequent positive test results. &#160;An employee's request for counseling or treatment shall not serve as a basis for denial of benefits, promotional opportunities or the termination of employment.&#160;&#160;Voluntary use of the EAP shall be confidential and this information shall not be reported to any person within the Caddo Parish School System, unless mandated by federal and/or state law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SUPERVISORY REFERRALS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This type of referral is when the supervisor or principal encourages the use of the <i>Employee Assistance Program</i> when the performance of an employee appears to be a contributing factor causing disruption in the workplace. &#160;The supervisor may use this type of referral for the purpose of helping the employee.&#160;&#160;The decision to accept assessment, treatment and/or referral is solely the responsibility of the employee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>FITNESS-FOR-DUTY/MANAGEMENT DIRECTED REFERRAL</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This type of referral is used to address employee situations that require immediate attention and for which an employee should not be allowed to remain in the workplace until the problem is resolved.&#160;&#160;Such a referral may <b><i>only</i></b> be issued by the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent/Chief, or the appropriate Director of Human Resources.&#160;&#160;The purpose of the referral is to address extraordinary situations where an employee poses a potential hazard or risk to themselves or others in the workplace.&#160;&#160;It may also be used to determine an employee’s fitness to perform the job functions. &#160;Some reasons for this type of referral include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Violence or threats of violence in the workplace;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suicidal/safety risk;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirmed or self-reported drug/alcohol use in the workplace/safety risk.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The employee may be (1) referred to the EAP office or (2) allowed to obtain services from a health care provider (HCP) selected by the employee who practices in the same area/field of expertise that the EAP office would utilize as a referral to the employee. &#160;Any costs for services not covered by the employee's insurance benefits shall be the responsibility of the employee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The employee has the right to accept or refuse the services.&#160;&#160;However, if the employee refuses services under this type of referral, appropriate administrative action(s) may be taken concerning the job performance or conduct issue that prompted the referral in accordance with School Board policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the employee participates in the referral process, the employee shall agree that the EAP office shall be contacted in advance of the appointment (whether to EAP provider or HCP selected by the employee) to provide background information about the employee and details of the job performance or conduct issue that is of concern.&#160;&#160;The employee shall be required to sign a release authorizing the EAP office or HCP to release certain limited information and reports to a designated School Board administrator (Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent/Chief, or appropriate Director of Human Resources).&#160;&#160;This information shall be limited to the following: whether the employee kept the initial EAP or HCA appointment; whether the employee agreed or disagreed to follow the EAP’s or HCA’s recommendations; continuing compliance updates and progress toward fitness for duty; specific recommendations, if any, for allowing the employee to return to work; and closure of services. &#160;The EAP office or HCP shall provide this information to the designated School Board administrator (Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent/Chief, or appropriate Director of Human Resources) upon their request for information.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>BENEFITS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All appropriate leave-of-absence policies and group insurance coverage shall apply to EAP services as outlined in the organization's insurance plan.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>RECORDS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All records created within the EAP shall be stored and maintained within the Employee Assistance Office. &#160;These records shall not become part of any employee's personnel file.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All records maintained by the EAP shall be destroyed according to federal or state coding of the subject matter.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees shall have access to their records, but the release of that information to another agency, in-house department or the general public (verbally or written) requires a signature from the employees, except when mandated by federal or state law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>CONFIDENTIALITY</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All referrals to the EAP office shall be treated as confidential. &#160;All employees working in the EAP office and other employees within the district having access to confidential referral information shall sign a statement indicating that he/she shall maintain as confidential, the information submitted to the EAP office or to the designated Administrator.&#160;&#160;Information may only be shared as necessary to perform the job duties of the individual employee having access to the confidential information.&#160;&#160;&#160;Failure to maintain the confidence of the information submitted shall result in disciplinary action in accordance with School Board policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>REFERRAL TO OUTSIDE AGENCIES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The EAP may make a referral to an outside agency or other appropriate sources; however, it is the employee's choice to accept such referral(s). &#160;<b>Any costs for services not covered by the employee’s insurance benefits shall be the responsibility of the employee.</b></p>
