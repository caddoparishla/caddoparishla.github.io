<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;A. Except as hereinafter provided, depositories of parish school boards and city school boards shall pay out the school funds entrusted to their charge only on checks signed by the president and the treasurer of the boards or by any two officers or persons designated by the board. A parish school board or a city school board may, however, authorize its president and treasurer to sign a master payroll check to be deposited in a special payroll account, in which case the signature of the treasurer or such other officer or person as is designated by the board shall be sufficient for the payment of the individual payroll checks drawn against the special payroll account.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;B. Any parish school board and any city school board may, by resolution adopted at a regular or special meeting, authorize its president and treasurer, or either of them, or such other officers or persons as it designates, to use a check signing machine or other similar mechanical device for facsimile signatures in signing any or all checks issued by the school board and requiring the signature of either or both of these officers or persons. The resolution shall state the conditions under which such facsimile signature or signatures shall be used and shall state the precautions to be exercised by the officer or officers to prevent fraud in the use of such signatures.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;C. All persons authorized to sign checks or warrants drawn against the school funds shall furnish a surety bond in an amount to be determined by the school board but which shall be not less than fifteen thousand dollars, for the faithful performance of their duties.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;D. The cancelled checks paid by the depository, as herein provided, shall be returned to the treasurer, be retained by him and filed in his office as vouchers.</p>
