<p class="Title">RESPONSIBILITY FOR VEHICLE OPERATION</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-underline: black;">BOARD-OWNED OR LEASED VEHICLES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board shall require that <b>only</b> authorized employees with valid drivers’ licenses be allowed to operate and drive vehicles owned or leased by the School Board. &#160;<i>Authorized employees</i> shall be those employees whom the school system has authorized to drive School Board-owned or leased vehicles after having their driving records and insurance qualifications examined for acceptability by School Board staff.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>School Board-owned vehicles shall only be assigned to employees who are required to be on twenty-four (24) hour call for emergency situations or have a specific job requirement which necessitates use of a School Board-owned vehicle. &#160;Such vehicles shall be assigned to employees based upon the written recommendation of his/her department supervisor. &#160;The Superintendent shall approve all take-home vehicle assignments (excluding temporary assignment of staff cars). &#160;No assigned vehicle may be loaned to or operated by another employee without prior written approval of his/her department supervisor. &#160;The Superintendent shall approve any long-term reassignment of a vehicle.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall require the highest possible standards of safety of its employees in the operation of vehicles owned, operated, or leased by or on behalf of the School Board. &#160;Every employee shall observe all laws as well as School Board policies, administrative regulations and procedures governing the use, care and operation of vehicles. Accordingly, no person may be hired or employed for any position which includes duties involving the operation of a School Board owned or leased vehicle who has a motor vehicle record with violations for driving while intoxicated or under the influence, leaving the scene of an accident, or other serious motor vehicle violations, nor whose driver’s license is suspended.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent and/or his/her designee shall maintain pertinent administrative regulations and procedures governing the use, care, and operation of any School Board vehicle.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-underline: black;">ARRESTS OR CITATIONS FOR MOTOR VEHICLE VIOLATIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A <i>school bus operator</i> shall report his/her arrest for violation of any law or local ordinance that prohibits operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any abused substance or controlled dangerous substance set forth in the drug schedules enumerated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a id="id7" href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/400964.htm');return false;" name="id7">40:964</a>. &#160;<i>School bus operator</i> shall mean <b>any</b> employee or contract driver of the School Board whose duty is to transport students in any school bus or activity bus to and from school or to and from any school-related activity.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The report shall be made by the operator to the Superintendent or his/her designee. &#160;Such report shall be made within twenty-four (24) hours of the arrest or prior to the operator next reporting for his/her work assignment as a school bus operator, whichever time period is shorter. &#160;Such report shall be made by the school bus operator regardless of who owns or leases the vehicle being driven at the time of the offense for which the operator was arrested and regardless of whether the operator was performing an official duty or responsibility at the time of the offense.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A school bus operator who fails to report his/her arrest for violations of operating a vehicle as noted above shall be terminated by the School Board if the operator is serving a probationary term of employment, or shall be subject to removal as provided for by state law if the operator is tenured. &#160;If the bus operator is tenured, written and signed charges alleging such failure to report violations shall be brought against the bus operator.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any employee of the School Board employed for any position which includes duties involving the operation of a School Board owned or leased vehicle, or operating a private vehicle, at any time, shall report by telephone and in writing to the Superintendent or his/her designee, any citation, summons, or arrest for driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, driving while intoxicated, leaving the scene of an accident, driving while license is suspended, or other serious motor vehicle violations. &#160;Such report shall be required whether the usage is of a school district owned or leased vehicle or a personal/private vehicle. &#160;Failure to report any such violations within twenty-four (24) hours after any arrest or citation shall be a violation of this policy and subject the employee to discipline including the possible termination of employment. &#160;All reports to the Superintendent or his/her designee shall be forwarded to the personnel office for review as to any possible disciplinary action and reporting to the School Board's insurer.&#160;&#160;If denied coverage by the insurer, an employee may be terminated.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In the event a citation, summons or arrest involves the operation of a School Board owned or leased vehicle, the driving privileges of an employee may be immediately removed. For an employee whose primary duty is the driving of a School Board owned or leased vehicle, the employee may be suspended by the School Board with or without pay, or terminated if the violation results in conviction, in accordance with School Board policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-underline: black;">MOTOR VEHICLE DRIVING RECORD</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent or his/her designee shall, at a minimum of twice a year, submit a list of employees who drive School Board-owned or leased vehicles, as well as any employee whose duties require the use of a School Board or privately owned vehicle in the course and scope of their responsibilities, to the Louisiana Department of Motor Vehicles for verification of driving records and for updating information provided to the insurer.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Any driving while intoxicated (DWI) conviction or refusal to submit to a lawful field sobriety test shall result in disciplinary action up to and including suspension of School Board driving privileges.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee whose driver’s license has been suspended for any reason shall not be allowed to operate any vehicle in the performance of his/her employment.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee who has been determined to be at fault in two (2) or more accidents within a twenty-four (24) month period while driving a vehicle in the course and scope of their employment shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including suspension of School Board driving privileges.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the temporary or permanent suspension of School Board driving privileges causes an unreasonable hardship for the School Board, this shall be considered grounds for disciplinary action.</p>
</li>
