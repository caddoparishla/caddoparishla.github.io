<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;Each parish and city school board within the state shall administer this Subpart and secure its enforcement with other state and parish agencies mentioned herein. To facilitate the enforcement of this Subpart each parish and city school board shall employ at least one competent, qualified, and certified visiting teacher, or supervisor of child welfare and attendance. The parish or city school boards shall appoint such additional visiting teachers, or supervisors of child welfare and attendance, or home-school coordinators as are necessary to achieve a ratio of not less than one such officer for every seven thousand five hundred students provided that additional personnel shall be added when funding is provided using state and/or federal funds for such salary and benefits and when the student population reaches a major fraction of seven thousand five hundred students over any multiple of seven thousand five hundred students. Each parish and city school board shall fix the compensation of such visiting teachers, supervisors of child welfare and attendance, or home-school coordinators, payable from the school funds of the parish or city, and shall prescribe the duties of such visiting teachers, supervisors of child welfare and attendance, or home-school coordinators and make such rules and regulations for the performance thereof as are not inconsistent with law and regulations of the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. In addition, the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education shall prescribe guidelines for the employment and funding of the home-school coordinators who shall be non-supervisory school support employees under the direction of the supervisor of child welfare and attendance and the principals of the schools to which they are assigned. Such home-school coordinators shall possess a teaching certificate and shall be employed for nine months according to the teacher salary schedule. The addition of home-school coordinators to achieve a ratio of one for every seven thousand five hundred students shall be dependent on the approval of funding of such salary and benefits utilizing state and/or federal funds. Such costs shall not be included in the calculation of the minimum foundation formula.</p>
