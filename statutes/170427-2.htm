<p class="PdfParaStyle03">&#160;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle04" style="margin-left: 74px; text-indent: -74px;">17:427.2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critical Teacher Shortage Incentive Program; creation; purpose; definitions; contracts; administration; implementation; reporting; funding</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. There is hereby created the Critical Teacher Shortage Incentive Program, referred to in this Section as the "program", for the purpose of providing each newly certified teacher who agrees to practice his profession as a classroom teacher in the elementary or secondary schools of the state in the area of mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, or special education, three thousand dollars per year for the first four consecutive years for which the teacher practices his profession as provided in this Section.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">B. For purposes of this Section, "newly certified teacher" shall mean an individual who holds a valid Louisiana teaching certificate issued by the state Department of Education in the area of mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, or special education and who becomes employed as a classroom teacher in at least one of such areas of certification in a public elementary or secondary school in this state for the first time for the 2004-2005 school year.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">C. The program shall be administered by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, referred to in this Section as the "board", in accordance with such rules and regulations, established by the board pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, as are necessary for the implementation and administration of the program. Such rules and regulations shall include but shall not be limited to a requirement that the teacher enter into a contract with the board as part of the teacher certification process, agreeing to the terms and conditions as set forth in the contract including those specified in Subsection A of this Section. The board shall determine for each year of the contract with the teacher whether or not the teacher has complied with the terms of the contract. In making such determination the board shall consult with the principal of the school where the teacher is employed, who shall certify to the board at the end of each school year whether or not the teacher has met the terms of the contract relative to employment in his area of certification. If the teacher fails to comply with the terms of the contract as determined by the board, the teacher shall not receive the amount of funds as specified in Subsection A of this Section for that year.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">D. Implementation of the program as provided in this Section shall be subject to the appropriation of funds for such purpose.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">E. The State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education shall provide a written report annually to the House Committee on Education and the Senate Committee on Education on the implementation of the program. Such report shall include but shall not be limited to data collected by the board that identifies the critical teacher shortage areas that exist each year, if any, and the number of certified teachers employed in each area, as well as those needed in each area. At least once every two years, the House Committee on Education and the Senate Committee on Education shall meet jointly to review the data collected to determine if there is a continued need for the program and to recommend any necessary changes to the program based upon the information submitted by the board.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle08">Added by Acts 2001, No. 125, s 1. Amended by Acts 2003, No. 1069, s 1.</p>
