<p>A. Every vocational institute, college, and university offering nurses training shall, beginning October 1, 1991, keep a record of every request received for admittance into a nurse training program.&#160;&#160;Such records shall be maintained for each different program requested and shall document the response to the request, whether the response was admittance, denial, wait listing, or diversion into another program.&#160;&#160;The record shall contain the reason for the denial of any student requesting admittance into a nurse training program who is denied admission.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>B. Such records shall be submitted to the Board of Regents and the postsecondary education management boards on a quarterly basis and also shall be submitted to the Nursing Supply and Demand Council on whatever schedule it requests.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>C. (1) The Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges may:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(a) Request and obtain state and national criminal history record information on any person making application to enroll as a student in a nurse training program at any vocational institute or community college.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(b) Charge and collect from an applicant, in addition to all other applicable fees and costs, such amount as may be incurred by the board in requesting and obtaining criminal history record information on the applicant.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(c) In cooperation with the Louisiana State Board of Practical Nurse Examiners and the Louisiana Bureau of Criminal Identification and Information of the office of state police within the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, promulgate the rules and regulations, and establish procedures in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act that are necessary to implement the provisions of this Subsection.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) Any and all state or national criminal history record information obtained by the board which is not already a matter of public record shall be deemed nonpublic and confidential information restricted to the exclusive use of the board, its members, officers, investigators, agents, and attorneys in evaluating the applicant's eligibility or disqualification for enrollment.&#160;&#160;No such information or records related thereto shall, except with the written consent of the applicant or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, be released or otherwise disclosed by the board to any other person or agency.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(3) The board shall provide each institution under its jurisdiction with written standards specifying the requirements that must be met by an applicant to a nurse training program and the grounds on which an applicant may be denied acceptance to a program or denied a license upon completion of a program.&#160;&#160;The institution shall provide a copy of such standards to any person making application.</p>
