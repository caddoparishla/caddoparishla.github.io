<p class="whs2">&#160;</p>
<p>A. When an agency chooses not to avail itself of the provisions of R.S. 30:153 but leases its own lands, the agency shall sign all necessary or customary division orders or other documents incident to the production and sale of products under the lease.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>B. When an agency leases its own lands it shall receive and receipt for all sums accruing to it and shall deposit these funds to its account.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>C. In all cases where sixteenth section or school indemnity lands are leased, either by the State Mineral and Energy Board or the school board, all funds realized from these leases shall be paid to the school board of the parish where the lands are situated and credited to the current school fund of that parish, except that in the case of school indemnity lands, the lease shall be made by the State Mineral and Energy Board only and the funds credited to the parish school board entitled thereto.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>D. (1) In all cases where title to land exclusive of sixteenth section or school indemnity lands has been acquired by a school board for the benefit of a particular school or school district by grant or purchase without the incurring of any obligation, including but not limited to bonded indebtedness, by the residents of such school district, funds realized from a lease of such lands by either the school board or the mineral board, shall be paid to the school board. &#160;The school board shall have the option of either crediting all or part of these funds to either a special account to be applied to the uses of the particular school or school system for whose benefit the grant or purchase was made, or of crediting all or any part of such funds to the general fund of the school board to be used for purposes for which such fund may be used.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(2) In all cases where the acquisition of such lands involves the incurring of an obligation, including but not limited to bonded indebtedness, by the residents of a particular school district, the board shall have the same option as provided in R.S. 30:154(D)(1); &#160;however, if no other funds, including the tax revenues of such district, are available to pay such obligation, then the school board shall use all funds from such leases necessary to pay the obligation incurred to acquire such lands.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(3) If the particular school or school district specified in the grant no longer exists, the funds shall be placed in the general fund of the school board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
