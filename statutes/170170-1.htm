<p class="PdfParaStyle06">(2) The secretary shall establish a priority of cohorts of students who shall be required to be vaccinated in order to minimize the possibility of an outbreak of meningococcal disease.&#160;&#160;Such priority shall be established in consultation with the Board of Regents.</p>
