<p class="Title">BOARD AND STAFF COMMUNICATIONS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Caddo Parish School Board is committed to the concept of One Board/One Voice in order to advance the ideals of a quality education system in the Parish of Caddo.&#160;&#160;The intent is to provide appropriate comments to the public regarding matters of interest involving the Caddo Parish School System.&#160;&#160;The only way the concept of One Board/ One Voice will be successful is if the School Board and staff utilizes a system of communication that builds confidence in the School Board as well as staff.&#160;&#160;This concept is premised on the fact that no single School Board member has authority to act on behalf of the School Board and cannot bind the Caddo Parish School Board.&#160;&#160;Furthermore no individual employee may make a comment on behalf of the school system without appropriate authority.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
