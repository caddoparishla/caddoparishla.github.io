<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;A. The word "teacher", as used herein, shall mean any employee of the Department of Corrections who holds a teacher's certificate issued by the Department of Education of the state of Louisiana pursuant to the laws of the state of Louisiana and to the rules and regulations adopted by the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education and whose contract with the Department of Corrections requires instruction of persons confined in any institution under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections. All teachers employed by the Department of Corrections shall be subject to the employee rules and regulations of the Department of Corrections and the penalties provided therein for violations.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;B. The probationary term of each teacher shall be for a period of three years, commencing on the date of the first contract of employment at an institution. A probationary teacher may be dismissed, or otherwise disciplined by the Department of Corrections, upon written recommendation, accompanied by valid reasons therefor, of the secretary of corrections. However, all teachers who have attained permanent status on or before the effective date of this Section shall maintain their permanent status and teachers on probation before the effective date of this Section will not have their probationary terms lengthened solely because of passage of this Section.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;C. Any teacher found unsatisfactory by the Department of Corrections at the expiration of the probationary term shall be notified in writing that their employment contract will not be renewed. In absence of such notice a probationary teacher shall become a regular and permanent teacher employed by the Department of Corrections.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;D. A permanent teacher employed by the Department of Corrections shall not be disciplined or removed from office except upon written and signed charges of wilful neglect of duty, incompetence, dishonesty, or violation of the rules and regulations governing employees of the department, and then only if found guilty of such charges after a hearing by the Department of Corrections. All hearings conducted pursuant to this Section shall be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 13 of Title 49 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950 relative to adjudication. Judicial review of a decision of the board shall also be in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 49 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950.</p>
