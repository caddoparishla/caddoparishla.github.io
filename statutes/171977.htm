<p class="PdfParaStyle03">&#160;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle04">17:1977 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Procedural safeguards</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;The procedural safeguards required to be included in a statewide system shall provide, at a minimum, the following:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(1) The timely administrative resolution of complaints by parents. Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision regarding an administrative complaint shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint in any state court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States without regard to the amount in controversy. In any action brought under this Paragraph, the court shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party, and, basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(2) The right to confidentiality of personally identifiable information, including the right of parents to have written notice of and written consent to the exchange of such information among agencies consistent with federal and state law.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(3) The rights of the parents to determine whether they, their infant or toddler, or other family members will accept or decline any early intervention service under this Part in accordance with state law without jeopardizing other early intervention services under this Part.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(4) The opportunity for parents to examine records relating to assessment, screening, eligibility determinations, and the development and implementation of the individualized family service plan.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(5) Procedures to protect the rights of the infant or toddler whenever the parents of the infant or toddler are not known or cannot be found or the infant or toddler is a ward of the state, including the assignment of an individual, who shall not be an employee of the state's Lead Agency, or other state agency, and who shall not be any person, or any employee of a person, providing early intervention services to the infant or toddler or any family member of the infant or toddler to act as a surrogate for the parents.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(6) Written prior notice to the parents of the infant or toddler with special needs whenever the state agency or service provider proposes to initiate or change or refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or placement of the infant or toddler with special needs, or the provision of appropriate early intervention services to the infant or toddler.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(7) Procedures designed to assure that the notice required by Paragraph (6) of this Section fully informs the parents, in the parent's native language, unless it clearly is not feasible to do so, of all procedures available pursuant to this Section.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(8) During the pendency of any proceeding or action involving a complaint, unless the state agency and the parents otherwise agree, the child shall continue to receive the appropriate early intervention services currently being provided, or if applying for initial services, shall receive the services not in dispute.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle08">Acts 1995, No. 1228, ยง1, eff. June 29, 1995. Amended by Acts 1998, 1st Ex.Sess., No. 109, ยง1, eff. May 5, 1998.</p>
