<p class="PdfParaStyle02">CHAPTER 22-A. LOUISIANA STUDENT TUITION ASSISTANCE AND REVENUE TRUST PROGRAM</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle03">&#160;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle04" style="text-indent: -72px; margin-left: 72px;">17:3098 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Termination of depositor's agreements; refund; conversion of the account to money</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">A. (1) Unless otherwise provided for in the agreement, an education savings account owner's agreement may be terminated by the person entering into the agreement, the beneficiary, or by any person or combination of persons designated in the agreement as provided in this Section.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(2) An education savings account owner's agreement may be terminated under any of the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(a) Upon the death of the beneficiary.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(b) Upon notification to the Louisiana Tuition Trust Authority in writing that the beneficiary has decided not to attend an institution of higher education and requests that the education savings account be terminated.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(c) Upon completion of the requirements for a degree, diploma, or other affirmation of program completion at an institution of post-secondary education.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(d) Upon the occurrence of other circumstances determined by the authority to be grounds for termination.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">B. (1) The authority shall determine the method and schedule for payment of refunds upon termination of an education savings account.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(2) The amount of the refund to which the person designated in the account owner's agreement is entitled shall be equal to:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(a) The actual amount of the deposits if the account has been open for less than twelve months, or</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(b) The redemption value of the education savings account invested in fixed earnings at the time of the refund, minus any earnings enhancements, and interest earned thereon, previously credited but not expended from the account, if the account has been open for twelve or more months, or</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(c) The value of the education savings account invested in variable earnings at the time of the refund, minus any earnings enhancements and interest earned thereon previously credited but not expended from the account, if the account has been open for twelve or more months.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(3) Monies in accounts opened by juridical persons or classified under R.S. 17:3096(A)(1)(e) of this Chapter may not be refunded; however, the account owner or the authority, if the account owner has authorized the authority to designate the beneficiary, may designate a new beneficiary:</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(a) Upon the death of the beneficiary.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(b) If the beneficiary has decided not to attend an institution of higher education.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">(c) Upon the beneficiary's completion of the requirements for a degree, diploma, or other</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">affirmation of program completion at an institution of post-secondary education.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">C. If the beneficiary is the recipient of a scholarship, waiver of tuition, or similar subvention that the authority determines cannot be converted into money by the beneficiary, the authority shall, during each academic term that the beneficiary furnishes the authority such information about the scholarship, waiver, or similar subvention as the authority requires, refund to the person designated in the owner's agreement an amount from the owner's education savings account equal to the value of the scholarship, waiver, or similar subvention awarded to the beneficiary. The authority may, at its sole option, designate the institution of post-secondary education at which the beneficiary is enrolled as the agent of the authority for purposes of refunds pursuant to this Subsection.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">D. If, in any academic term for which withdrawals from the education savings account have been used to pay all or part of a beneficiary's qualified higher education expenses, the beneficiary withdraws from the institution of post-secondary education at which the beneficiary is enrolled prior to the end of the academic term, a pro rata share of any refund of the qualified higher education expenses resulting from the beneficiary's withdrawal from the institution, equal to that portion of the qualified higher education expenses paid by disbursements from the education savings account, shall be made to the authority, unless the authority designates a different procedure. The authority shall credit any refund to the appropriate education savings account.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">E. Amounts of money deposited which were exempt from state income taxation pursuant to R.S. 17:3095(A)(1)(b) and R.S. 47:293(6)(a)(vi) which are refunded to the account owner upon termination of an account or conversion of the amount as otherwise provided in this Section shall be declared as income for the purposes of state income taxation.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle08">Added by Acts 1995, No. 547, s 1, eff. June 18, 1995. Amended by Acts 1997, No. 1416, s 1, eff. July 15, 1997; Acts 2000, No. 45, s 1, eff.
