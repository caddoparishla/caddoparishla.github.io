<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. (1) No person shall sell any course of instruction or solicit students therefor in this state unless he first applies for and obtains a permit as a solicitor. The fee for each permit and each renewal thereof shall be one hundred dollars. If the solicitor represents more than one school, he shall obtain a separate permit for each school he represents.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(2) Upon approval of the application for a permit, the Board of Regents shall issue a permit in the form of a pocket card to the solicitor, giving his name, address, permit number, and the name and address of his employing school, and certifying that the person whose name appears on the card is an authorized solicitor of the school.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(3) Each permit shall be valid for one year from the date on which it is issued.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. (1) The application for a permit shall be made on forms which shall be furnished by the board and shall be accompanied by a surety bond acceptable to the board in the sum of one thousand dollars. Such bond shall be continuous. It shall be issued by a solvent surety authorized to do business in this state, shall be filed with the commissioner of higher education, and shall be conditioned to provide indemnification to any student suffering loss as a result of any fraud of misrepresentation used by the permittee in procuring his enrollment. The bond may be supplied by a solicitor for a school or by the school itself as a blanket bond covering each of its agents in the amount of one thousand dollars.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(2) The liability of the surety on such bond for each solicitor covered shall not exceed the sum of one thousand dollars as an aggregate for all students for all breaches of the conditions of the bond by such solicitors.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(3) The surety of any such bond may cancel the same upon giving thirty days' notice in writing to the commission and the board and upon giving such notice shall be relieved of liability for any breach of condition occurring after the effective date of the cancellation.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;(4) Each application for renewal shall be accompanied by a surety bond as provided in this Section.</p>
